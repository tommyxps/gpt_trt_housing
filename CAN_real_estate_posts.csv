- Find a city / market / home category where prices have already gone down at least 12-15% from the Feb 2022 peak

- Find a listing that has been on the market for 30+ days and has had 2 or more price changes 

- Determine the most recent and closest comparable you can find. Comparable should be from the last 10-14 days.

- Bid 12-15% below the last comparable 

- Add home inspection and financing conditions 

- Close in 30 days to avoid appraisal issues 

- Make sure you calculate your monthly payments on a 5% variable or fixed rate to be safe. Variable could easily get to 4.25-4.5% in the next 4-6 months. Fixed might move to 4.7-5.0% depending on BoC commentary after the July rate hike

- Make sure you intend to live in the place for 5-7 years at the minimum

'Elements of the incident first came to light in November, 2021, when 34 recently registered realtors had their licenses revoked for ‚Äúfailure to complete the designated educational courses required.‚Äù In December, another 20 licenses were voided by RECO for the same issue. Some of those who lost their license had already been trading real estate, handling down payments and other critical roles in the largest transactions most consumers make in their lifetimes. 
 
'What neither RECO or Humber College admitted at the time was those 54 voided registrants were just the tip of the iceberg.
***
'Perhaps the most startling revelation was the AG found there are more than 1,700 current realtors that disclosed a criminal charge or conviction on their registration applications (about 2 per cent of the approximately 98,000 salespersons in the province). The report alleges RECO has no formalized method to assess whether these charges or complaints should result in license revocation. The AG looked at examples of recent registrants with assault and assault with a weapon charges, as well as one person convicted of large-scale credit-card fraud and another convicted for kiting cheques, or making use of non-existent funds.'",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/zhgsh0/auditor_general_finds_hundreds_cheated_on_real/,Auditor General finds hundreds cheated on real estate license exams,Agent,122,25,0.98

10au9y3,TorontoRealEstate,1673615715.0,"Flash back to early 2022 - our lease was ending as our landlord's daughter was moving into our condo. My husband and I needed someplace to live and decided we would finally look to buy our own condo after saving frivolously for a downpayment for 9 years. Our dream became a reality in February 2022, when we ""won"" a bidding war that had 21 registered offers. This was a tumultuous time, as we were viewing condos 3-4 times a week for months straight, and our offers were getting rejected left, right, and centre.  Many of our lost offers were to corporations (according to our realtor), and we simply couldn't compete so we felt defeated. When we finally decided to play the game of offering way over asking, we were successful and secured a home.

Fast forward to one year later, and we hate if here. Our neighbour has made our lives a living hell (see last post). Though interest rates have gone crazy, my husband scored a new job with an increased salary so we're doing just fine month to month. However, our condo is in the West end, and his job is in the east end, about a 1 hr 20 minute commute by TTC each way. His aging mother has also moved to the east end, so now we're looking to move to that side of the city. But given the 10%+ drop in condos since peak market, we would likely lose anywhere between $50-75k of our hard earned money if we were to move right now. Probably more since we put in $15k in renovating this condo thinking we'd stay for the long term. However, our mental health is suffering living here. I've started to miss my menstrual cycle (not pregnant) due to the stress, and my husband has been ""joking"" about dark thoughts. Yes, we're both in therapy. 

Of course, I acknowledge our privilege, and these are clearly first world problems, but it still sucks. We weren't some greedy speculators hoarding housing supply - just early millennials looking to get into the housing market and buy our first home. For those who are wondering, we bought a 2 bedroom 2 bath condo, 750 sq ft for $820k in a downtown-adjace neighbourhood in the west end. 

One of our friends that finally bought their first home a few months before us (after renting a house with their two kids for 12 years), are not doing too well due to the interest rate hikes. They have a variable mortgage and are paying something like $1500 more each month, and they're struggling to get by as their new rate far exceeds the stress test at the time of their purchase. The wife has also gone on disability and can no longer work. They live in a suburb that has dropped about 30% since the peak, so they'd be selling at a loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars and possibly pulling their kids out of school and moving to a new province.

I guess I'm just looking to add a new perspective to those praying for a complete crash, as it will affect many regular folks as well. 

We're likely going to sell at a loss soon and try to move forward with a fresh start.

They didn't qualify a year ago, and they certainly don't qualify now.   

I remember a thread on here where the poster was being coached into fraud.  They told him/her to make sure the closing date of both properties line up on the same day.  This way the brokers, lawyers, and lenders will be completely in the dark.  I warned very strongly against this, because even if your ethics don't stop you, the chances of extreme catastrophe is incredibly high.  I really hope they didn't commit fraud, but if they did, I hope they got bit in the ass hard.

My question to anyone caught up in this.  What's the plan now? Can you even get a hold of your magic broker? Are you going to forge your way to closing these deals now, sit on them for months, hoping to sell at a lower price? How well did your fraud pan out?

&#x200B;

mortgage agents i deal with are tripping out, their clients are all firm on deals and they can't get an answer from the banks in time for closing or banks are fully pulling out of deals, appraisals not coming in etc. its ugly. several mortgage agents ive spoken to are near tears .

&#x200B;

also seeing people on TIKTOK of all places tripping out. horror stories.  and i've been hearing them often. like this one:

[https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMNaP6pmV/?k=1](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMNaP6pmV/?k=1)

all anecdotes for now, but the vibe is real. at the least wait a month to a year to see how this plays out. i could be wrong, and have been a perma bear scaredy cat for a few years now so i could be off once again and things bounce back and get crazy but i dont see how. our whole economy is run on real estate. double whammy of recession and much higher rates simply doesn't play out well.

demand is still there and tons of buyers on sidelines, but if they cant get financing who cares?? anyone else hearing/seeing things out there?

&#x200B;

I thought I'd try and add a realistic summary of what's going on from the point of view of someone who keeps an eye on global economic and monetary trends and has been investing in the stock market for a few years now. Here is a high-level summary of how we got here and where we are likely headed (my opinion only). I am not bullish on real estate, the stock market or the economy in general.

1. We started off pre-pandemic with an acknowledged housing bubble in certain cities in Canada (primarily Vancouver and Toronto)
2. Interest rates being low since 2008 were a driving force coupled with an unwillingness by anyone in government to tackle the very obvious speculation and money laundering in real estate. MPs like Taleeb and even our current housing (and diversity?) minister (Hussein) actively had and continue to have multiple fingers in multiple housing pies. The government encouraged speculation and enjoyed the 'paper growth' it added to the GDP. You didn't need hindsight to see that this was a bad idea.
3. A 20 year bull cycle in Canadian real estate (particularly in Vancouver and the GTA) coupled with a lack of government action to address speculation led to excessive confidence among buyers and investors who confidently declared (and continue to do so) that 'RE in Canada only goes up'. Canada was spared the lessons of 2008 that US real estate investors experienced. The main lesson of the 2008 crisis was that real estate does crash and it tends to crash very badly when it does.
4. Interestingly, we saw a slight decline in some cities around 2017-2018 as interest rates crept up a bit and some foreign buyer taxation was passed (in Vancouver anyway). However, the government continued to ignore that a large part of speculative demand was driven by domestic investors. They still pretend like this isn't happening. The supply that is starting to show up is proving there are more domestic 'investors' than they wanted to acknowledge.
5. It's 2020 and Covid arrived. No one saw it coming. Asset classes started to dive but central banks around the world decided to lower interest rates to nearly 0 and proceeded to lend copious amounts of money to governments. The great everything bubble is born.
6. Inflation arises and the exact cause is hotly debated. Personally, I believe it was a combination of low interest rates, excessive cheap debt and speculation in certain asset classes coupled with real world supply chain and logistics issues. I don't believe inflation will go away for a long, long time. I think it will take minimum 2-3 years and possibly longer if they don't raise rates high enough or decide to pause/reduce before the data shows that inflation has been properly dealt with. Inflation is as much psychological as it is a physical aspect of prices.
7. 2022, we get a war in Ukraine - the world's 'breadbasket'. No one saw it coming. I didn't even know they were the world's breadbasket until the war. As it turns out, this war is bad news for everyone and it arrives at a time when economies worldwide are still on their knees from the global pandemic shock. Now we have to deal with an energy crisis and a foodgrain crisis in the VERY NEAR future.
8. Together, inflation and the war exacerbate the problem of supply and affordability. Prices go up and we are now headed towards serious shortages worldwide coupled with inflating prices in certain key commodities. Several countries have begun to ban exports of critical commodities (like wheat and foodgrains). The impact of this is YET to be felt.
9. The US Federal Reserve have realized their error and have begun to raise rates. They realize they were too slow to address inflation (it wasn't 'transitory' after all) and have lost a lot of credibility. Bond rates reflect this and forced their hand too. The US Feds understand that if they lose more credibility, the US dollar begins to lose its status as a reliable world currency and store of value. They must aggressively rein in inflationary expectations and keep the value of the USD fairly stable. This is good for international trade and business (which the US and every nation ultimately depends on today).
10. At the same time, owing to massive government debt burdens and inflated asset classes (stocks, housing and some commodities), rising rates pose a problem for heavily indebted businesses, individuals and governments. 20 years of increasing stimulus is hard to wean off.

This is the situation we are in now. If central banks don't forcefully address inflation by raising rates, the idea that everything is getting more expensive will become embedded into people's everyday expectations. Can you imagine if the cost of everyday goods that has seen a sudden price increase in the last 12 months doubles by this time next year? How will you react? Will you buy more or save your money in expectation of future expenses?

This is also why we are undoubtedly heading into the worst recession of our lifetimes. Put aside your bullish or bearish bias and consider how many unprecedented shocks the entire global system has endured over the last 3 years. During this time, asset classes have inflated when everything should have been logically contracting. The reason is simple - they borrowed heavily from the future (or from thin air if you prefer to think of it that way) to stabilize an unsteady situation. Instead of the money being used to support and grow local economies in a productive manner, people and businesses used it to speculate on assets (people overleveraged on housing and businesses on share buybacks, corporate bonuses, etc.). Obviously, there was little or no growth generated to compensate for these temporarily cheap loans.

Now, central banks and governments have to choose - do they sacrifice the asset bubbles and allow the system to reset in a healthy if painful way or keep playing the cheap debt game and watch the problem get bigger until it explodes in an unpredictable way in the not very distant future. If it wasn't for Covid and all that followed, they could have possibly kept the system going for a lot longer. They weren't counting on this 'black swan event' from disrupting a fragile system.

**Outcomes:**

House prices are going down. This is going to shock many people because all we've witnessed for 20 years is housing go up (in Canada anyway).

It doesn't matter if you paid $1 million for your townhouse in Scugog or Mission or wherever - it was never really worth $1 million anyway. The hope that this ponzi scheme (that is what it essentially is, just official and endorsed) will continue indefinitely makes 0 sense. Housing is tied to the stability of local economies and the cost of housing (buying or renting) directly impacts how much money people have left over to spend on other areas of the economy. Surely, even the least financially educated person must realize that housing is a non-productive asset ultimately. If allowed to inflate so far beyond affordability to the point where even renting isn't an option for a sizebale chunk of your population, your economy is going to die.

The stock market is going down. This is already playing out in real time. We may see short rallies but ultimately, a bear market is setting in. Stocks are far more liquid than houses so we see moves in this asset class before we see it in housing. It has already begun in the US. Pay attention to how it plays out there. It has also already begun here in Canada and will continue to spiral downwards.

We are headed into the worst recession of our lifetime. There are simply no precedents for the situation we find ourselves in (not just Canada, but all countries globally). Things have never looked so bleak and the confidence being feigned by governments and central banks are a facade. They are frightened as they rightfully should be.

Why do so many people who represent regular retail believe that they know more than billionaires and smart money? Many very successful businessmen (Grantham, Dalio, Burry to name just 3) as well as several noted economists have all being saying for some time now that things are about to get much worse than people expect.

The people who have seen their assets inflate want to believe that the gravy train will keep going. It's human nature - I'm winning and why won't my pile of money keep getting bigger forever? But this time things really are different. It's going to hurt asset class owners as much as it has everyone else. The heavily overleveraged are about to suffer the worst.

Final note - this sort of turmoil tends to lead to unpredictable outcomes. We didn't see covid coming, we didn't see the Ukraine war and we didn't see inflation arising. Yet, everyone thinks it will be smooth sailing from here? I think things are going to get much worse before they get any better. Things could play out smoothly - they could (magically) get inflation under control in 6 months but try and think logically about everything that has led to where we are and all the other unexpected surprises along the way - do you really believe everything is going to move smoothly from here?

**Edit:** I forgot to add - The BoC is also about to embark on QT (Quantitative Tightening) for the first time in its history. This is the opposite of QE and is just one more factor to keep an eye on.

Also, the number of emotional reactions should tell you just how much of this bubble was driven by sentiment.

List price was 845 and we came in at 780, only to find out we were the only registered offer - they countered with 899 which we are not entertaining.  Bottom line, you can definitely offer way less than lost and still be the only bidder - not everything is a bidding war these days :) probably not going to get this one because sellers like to play games, but this was a great lesson for us that I wanted to share. 

Our instincts were right that the seller was asking for too much and everyone else felt the same ( those who saw the listing and didn‚Äôt view, as well as those who went to see the place).

Plenty of comps from summer to October in the area - that made me think of a low 700 offer - I tried to adjust with inflation as well as corresponding mortgage payments to reflect changes in affordability due to rising rates. Since nothing sold in 5 months, there is not much to reference in recent transactions and it feels like there needs some price discovery. 

Edit: added what seller countered with :) 

Edit2: not upset about not being accepted. great point below that both seller and buyer did what they were supposed to do, just not a match and we‚Äôre moving on. I should have been more explicit with my points (1) not a single other offer is very telling (2) you don‚Äôt need to max yourself out as a buyer. Re my ‚Äúlowball‚Äù offer, sure it‚Äôs low for the seller but generous based on my analysis that started with $/sqft.

u3k4rb,TorontoRealEstate,1649950207.0,"Hi Redditors,

Just wanted to share my recent post about what has been going on in the Toronto & GTA real estate market. Hopefully, some of you find it interesting and informative. 

They say that history repeats itself and it looks like our real estate market¬†is heading for a reprise of what happened exactly 5 years ago. For those who have forgotten,¬†March 2017 saw real estate prices up a record 34% only to tumble 18% within the next few months. 2022 started off in a similar fashion with home values¬†up 30%.¬†However, as per TRREB's latest report, prices have started to slide downwards, particularly in the suburbs. Despite positive year-over-year growth with average sale prices up 18.5% across the GTA, the month-to-month numbers from February to March paint a different picture with the same metric down by 3%. Now, I am not saying a monthly dip is evidence of a looming correction or crash, but I do believe there are other factors¬†that will likely¬†contribute to this downward trend.  


Remember the supply shortage we kept hearing about? Well, March boasted 20,000 new listings, a 43% jump from February. In fact, the sales-to-listings ratio decreased from 0.64 to 0.55, with 0.5 being the benchmark for a so-called ""balanced market"". While some properties are indeed still drawing competitive bidding wars, many agents have reported fewer offers from earlier this year. 

[Thanks to r\/xelan\_gta for the helpful chart!](https://preview.redd.it/xk29ww23jit81.jpg?width=856&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=36ad2f198460af7aa3228d829cd713bb65ddba31)

To add fuel to the fire, the Bank of Canada just announced a massive interest rate hike of 0.5%, double the increase in March.¬†üì∑For some context, the central bank has not raised interest rates by such an amount since the year 2000. This comes as Canada desperately tries to rein in runaway inflation of 5.7% as per the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Shortly after the announcement, TD and RBC bumped up their prime rates, which will affect customers holding variable-rate mortgages and lines of credit. First-time buyers looking to get into the market will also¬†suffer from decreasing purchasing power. For every 0.5% increase in interest rates, borrowing power decreases by around 5%.

[Borrowing power drops by about 5&#37; for every 0.5&#37; increase in interest rates.](https://preview.redd.it/e74qp3f9jit81.jpg?width=1087&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=261686ff10de267cdb6ad5e3c7b5c0c415fc88b4)

On the other hand, the Liberal government's call for a 2-year ban on foreign buyers is unlikely to have much of an impact on prices. According to StatsCan, foreign ownership in¬†Ontario comes in at just 2.2% and a ban on non-residents purchasing real estate will do little to cool things down. Conversely, a restriction on local investors looking to flip residential properties could be effective at curbing competition for end users. Moreover, the Fed's promise to build 1 million new homes certainly sounds great, while being completely unrealistic. To make homes affordable once again, we must focus efforts on decreasing the demand for our existing supply of homes.¬†

As you can see, there are many changes taking place right now but are we really headed for a correction? Only time will tell. Would love to hear everyone's thoughts on where we are headed.

There's a lot to take in. True to my moniker on reddit, here's an excerpt from the article about interest rates. I find eight to nine percent stress test mortgage rates a bit shocking but in 1990, it was 13% mortgage rates. In the early 1980s, 20+% mortgage rates.

""Economists predict the Bank of Canada‚Äôs overnight rate will reach 4.25 per cent by the end of the year ‚Äî up a quarter of a percentage point from earlier forecasts. The current overnight rate is 3.25 per cent.

A 4.25 per cent overnight rate will result in major banks setting their prime lending rate to 6.45 per cent. The stress test, which adds two per cent to the qualifying mortgage rate, means people will need to qualify for a mortgage with an interest rate of eight to nine per cent, real estate experts say.

However, even if interest rates remain at the 3.25 per cent for the next year it‚Äôs ‚Äúplenty sufficient to cause a lot of pain,‚Äù said Rabidoux.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/yao64z/thestar_torontos_real_estate_market_will_crash_30/,"TheStar - Toronto‚Äôs real estate market will crash 30% or more by the spring, economists say.

xtrkyb,TorontoRealEstate,1664724535.0,"For those that are interested, here are some highlights for GTA September sales from HouseSigma.  Note that these numbers may change slightly in the next few days as sometimes data is delayed (e.g. from yesterday to today, sales went up by 50 units).  Note this data is for all of the GTA; not just the 416.  Of course, real estate is local so some areas could be doing better and some could be doing worse.  Take everything with a grain of salt. 

  
Below is the September sales history for all of the GTA.  I have listed the year, the number of active listings at the end of the month, the number of sales for the month, and the months of inventory (i.e. Active divided by Sales). 

Year:   Active/Sales;    Months of Inventory   
2022:  13712/4608;     2.976   
2021:  9198/9197;       1.000   
2020:  18108/10693;  1.693   
2019:  16396/7984;    2.054   
2018:  18949/6651;    2.849   
2017:  18049/6435;    2.805   
2016:  10908/9833;    1.109   
2015:  17118/8273;    2.069   
2014:  18223/8111;    2.247   
2013:  19311/7395;    2.611   
2012:  22099/6259;    3.531   
2011:  19722/8076;    2.442   
2010:  21042/6561;    3.207   
2009:  17117/8642;    1.980   
2008:  28500/6626;    4.301

Summary: Sales were abysmal clearly being the worst in at least 15 years (down 49.90% Y/Y and 26.38% below the next worst year).  Active listings were definitely on the low side which could account for some of this.  In fact, if one adds the number of listings still active and the number of sales (to get the total number of properties that could have been bought), we are at least at a 15 year low.  Does this mean inventory is tight?  Well, the months of inventory is the best it has been in 10 years and is slightly higher than in the 2017/18 slowdown.  So listings are low, but demand is lower?

&#x200B;

Below are the median prices for each type of housing unit throughout the GTA.  I have included the month over month change (all up, most slightly), the change since the peak in February, and the year over year change.  Remember, we are comparing apples to oranges even in each category and if you are looking to determine how much a specific house is worth, you would need to examine the neighbourhood more closely.   
   
Detached:     $1,258,250; up 0.82% M/M, down 23.87% from Feb., down 7.82% Y/Y   
Semi:                 $990,000; up 2.06% M/M, down 25.56% from Feb., down 4.81% Y/Y   
Free-Town:       $950,000; up 2.37% M/M, down 23.39% from Feb., down 0.52% Y/Y   
Condo-Town:   $765,000; up 0.72% M/M, down 18.20% from Feb., up 1.32% Y/Y   
Condo Apt:       $645,000; up 0.58% M/M, down 12.84% from Feb., up 0.78% Y/Y   
Link (89 Sales): $950,000; up 1.60% M/M, down 24.07% from Feb., down 9.62% Y/Y   
   
The question is, are these month over month median price increases seasonal?  To see whether this was the case, I computed the M/M from August to September for detached and condo apartments (as the number of unit sold in these categories constitutes the majority of the sales; if you would like the other data, feel free to request it).  Here are the results: 

2022: detached up 0.82%, condo up 0.58%   
2021: detached up 3.80%, condo up 1.45%

106fe4b,TorontoRealEstate,1673171333.0,"Hello,

Looking for some advice here. I bought a condo in downtown Toronto in January 2022 with 1.2% variable open payment, now the rate is 5.2%. Spoke to my mortgage broker yesterday and below are the 3 options I have.

Option 1 (5 yr. fixed @ 4.84%) - $500 penalty to break mortgage (broker will cover the balance)

Option 2 (3 yr. fixed @ 4.99%) - $3500 penalty to break mortgage (broker will cover the balance)

Option 3 ‚Äì Ride the variable wave and hope rates plateau by Q2 2023/ start dropping by Q3 2023

Broker is suggesting I wait a few months and see what happens as he can hold these rates for me for 120 days (4 months). Only downside to this is if rates continue to go up in 2023 (which they likely will) the penalty to break mortgage will increase. It‚Äôs not like I cannot afford my 5.2% payments but seeing all the extra money go towards interest is a huge waste and discouraging.

Conflicting interest rate predictions from the different big banks don‚Äôt really help either:

CIBC: Long-term interest rates in Canada and the U.S. could be at lower levels at the end of 2023

RBC: Prime rates could go ‚Äòwell above‚Äô 7% in 2023

TD: Peak overnight rate will be 4.5% in Q1 2023 and reduced back to ‚Äòneutral‚Äô levels by Q4 2023 with rate reaching 2% by 2025

Scotia: Overnight rate will be reduced by 0.25% to 4% by Q4 2023 and lowered again by 1% to 3% by Q4 2024.

BMO: One last 0.25% rate hike in January which will be held through the rest of 2023

Thoughts on this? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Also can someone please share the link to where I can find latest data comparing interest rate and CPI on the same graph? Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/106fe4b/12_variable_mortgage_now_52/,1.2% variable mortgage now 5.2%,Requesting Advice,71,57,0.94

‚ÄúThere has been a marked tightening in global financial conditions,‚Äù Macklem said. ‚ÄúBy and large that has been reasonably orderly. That tightening is intended, it is needed to control inflation.‚Äù

Characterizing the mood at the meetings as one of both ‚Äúconcern‚Äù and ‚Äúresolve,‚Äù Macklem noted elevated uncertainty stemming from unresolved supply chain issues, energy price volatility and recent liquidity problems. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also concern about possible unintended consequences of the needed tightening in financial conditions,‚Äù Macklem said, citing turmoil in metals, energy and U.K. pension markets.
Still, he agreed with the IMF‚Äôs recent assessment of the risks to monetary policy. Earlier in the week, the fund said the consequences of spiraling inflation caused by under-tightening are a bigger worry than over-tightening borrowing costs.
The Bank of Canada is poised to push ahead with at least another 50 basis point interest-rate hike on Oct. 26. The benchmark rate currently stands at 3.25 per cent, three percentage points higher than the emergency pandemic low that held until March.
‚ÄúIn the current context, inflation is not just high. It‚Äôs a long way above 2 per cent target.

wn2iyi,TorontoRealEstate,1660356264.0,"I just had my offer on a semi-detached home accepted yesterday. I would have preferred to buy later, however, with a baby coming real soon and a new job in Mississauga starting in late October I had to make a move.

But I thought I'd offer a quick anecdotal observation about what it's like out there, at least in Mississauga.

It might be quite obvious now but some sellers are getting incredibly desperate. After viewing a freehold townhouse the seller's agent called mine and heard about how I was still waiting to hear back about a new job in Mississauga. The seller's agent offered that we put an offer with a finance condition on whether or not I got the job offer. That's something my real estate agent with 20 years of experience  never heard of.

Properties that aren't as nice looking are definitely on the market for much longer (sometimes up to a month+). However, properties that are staged well and they're in decent shape are still selling within a week or two. Many more sellers are accepting offers any time rather than holding offer dates. Those that are accepting offers without an offer date seem to be more inclined to accept offers quickly after listing. I assume it's because sellers are much more aware of the current market direction.

We ended up finding a home we really like and put an offer at asking, which we believe was a reasonable price. Someone else had put in an offer that night as well, however, our closing date was quite aggressive and we went with no conditions. Though, I would have preferred not to and I could have probably paid a little less, with the new baby and new job we wanted to lock in this property. The reason for the aggressive close date of three weeks is so that the bank appraises sooner and before the likely rate hike in September. Also, there seems to be a lot less new inventory in Mississauga compared to places like Scarborough as well, so all that's left are the undesirable properties or seller's who are reluctant to be realistic with price. We were told by the seller's agent that they picked our offer over the other because we went without conditions even though the other offer was higher, but who knows if  realtor is lying.

I realize there's a high chance that the value of our home could dip quite a bit in the near future, however, we are honestly very happy with this home and realize this is not an investment for us. Going from a two bedroom condo townhouse to a four bedroom freehold was something I never could have imagined.  A unit with the exact same layout but with more renos went for 400k what we just bought for . We're very glad that we were able to sell first in July to give us a stress-free ability to buy now.

Good luck to anyone out there who needs to buy or sell due to life circumstances like us.

‚ÄúThe train has left the station, but it‚Äôs not off the rails yet,‚Äù Hoyes said. ‚ÄúPeople are depleting the rest of their savings, they‚Äôre using whatever deferrals they can get‚Ä¶ But with each passing month, as interest rates go higher, as more mortgages roll over, car loans roll over, everything else rolls over, then the pressure builds and builds and builds.

‚ÄúSo, what I see is the pressure building over the next number of months and quarters, which inevitably leads to higher delinquencies, higher insolvencies, more loan defaults,‚Äù Hoyes continued. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen on Monday.‚Äù


Yeah‚Ä¶ immigration is going to solve all this. 

Just check 2008 debt ratio of USA vs today‚Äôs debt ratio. How they‚Äôll come out ‚Äúfine‚Äù is beyond me. As with Canadian mortgage amounts going up more and more each year: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202969/average-value-of-mortgage-loans-canada/ (this is the average but we all know people with way more than $300k mortgages lol). As far as I can tell, America and Canada are way more in debt than they were in previous years, hence why the great reset is a good thing for the overall economy and it will happen. 

Maybe a bull can educate us all on how after everything happening, house prices won‚Äôt *fall much more* OR how prices will *go up*. I‚Äôd really like a more logical explanation rather than emotional discussions. Saying you have a property/properties or you recently bought and you‚Äôre underwater or about to be underwater is not a logical explanation. 

If anything is mentioned, please bring actual data to match what you are also saying

vf5vcd,TorontoRealEstate,1655557589.0,"I got a call from someone yesterday who is in a jam that I doubt any of us would ever wish for.

He had an accepted offer in March, and the property is slated to close at the end of June, so plenty of time to arrange his mortgage. He went bank hopping, and settled on the one that offered him 0.03% cheaper and some cash back.  He signed the application, and waited patiently for over 2 months to hear anything.  Fast forward to the second week of June, where the bank rep calls him and says congratulations your application has finally been been approved, but unfortunately the appraisal is about 110K short, so we'll need some additional down payment.

This is when the magnitude of his choice dawned on him.  He is completely tapped out, no extra funds sitting in his account, no family to help him out, no time to go to a different lender, and the house value has gone down.  He is 100% responsible to close this transaction, and the bank in question isn't obligated to follow through with the mortgage approval.  I am one of several brokers he's contacted this week, and I'll go out on a limb and say the other brokers have told him similar to what I said.  We're sorry there's not a whole lot we can do.  We can arrange for a smaller private loan for you, which will be expensive, but I know this bank will not allow secondary financing behind them.  I can try with a B lender for you, but this is small town Ontario and very few lenders go there, or finally I can arrange a private loan for you for the entire mortgage amount, but it will be very expensive and chances are you'll be in it for a few years before you can switch out.

To give you a little more context, I did the math and the lower rate and cash back would've saved him a touch under $1,000 in 5 years vs the other big lender that I know covers that area and their approval times is 48 hours or less.  Was this gentleman a wise shopper that knew the difference between cheap and value? You judge.

I'm posting this for 2 reasons.  1) I really hope it drives home the point that cheap can be extremely costly, and 2) right about the time this was gentlemen opted to go for the cheaper rate I was arranging a mortgage for a client who I know reads this sub, and I honestly hope she catches this.  As soon as this lender started their promo, I notified her and said hey I'm one of a few brokers that has access to this lender, and I did the math, you'd save something like $1,500 over 5 years if you went with them but I'm warning you their turn around times are abysmal and you risk closing your purchase on time.  True to her profession, and her excellent financial habits, she said thank you but don't worry about it, proceed as planned with the original lender.  I thanked her right away for not putting us in the bad spot.  Law suits can be exhausting, lengthy, and very expensive.  This is exactly why I love working with professionals like her.  They see the bigger picture, they know the difference between cheap and value, and there's no mistaking the reason why people like her end up very secure financially in the long run.

For this gentleman, as awful as I feel for him, I'll be honest and say I won't take him on as a client.  I don't want to be involved in this pending law suit, and even to this day when talking with him, he still wanted the cheapest option that may or may not work in the extremely short 12 days he's got left.  Sometimes people's nature is next to impossible to change.

Please don't ask who the lender is with the horrendous turn around times, I will not name them, but I hope this post is of value to someone debating something similar.

Unfortunately, my experience with their Sales and Marketing team since our walkthrough leaves much to be imagined.

On our scheduled deficiency walkthrough, my partner and I noticed immediately that the unit was completed with the wrong finishing color. This was a huge oversight as the furnishings included the entire kitchen as well as our bathroom. Our condo was essentially half light and half dark theme. Considering how personal and central color and design are to apartment design, my partner and I were very upset by this development. I can't imagine how someone would react if they ordered a Black car and was presented with a White one instead!

When we brought up the fact to Jackie Chan, the Home Experience Manager, he seemed surprised by this fact. Jackie and one other member from the Home Experience team, Adam, left the apartment to ‚Äúcheck other units‚Äù to see the scope of the mistake that had been made. Considering how many orientations at this development Jackie had done, I‚Äôm surprised he hadn‚Äôt noticed sooner. When Jackie returned with Adam, Jackie‚Äôs response was to mansplain to my partner the process of bulk order and how all of the components in our apartment were ordered and procured long ago at the beginning of construction. We were still reeling in shock at what had happened. As soon as Jackie sensed our dissatisfaction, he immediately asked if we would be open to a ‚Äúmonetary compensation‚Äù.

The rest of the walkthrough was marred by this development and there was a cloud hanging over my and my partners head. We had dreamed of this apartment for over a year and were so excited to finally move into our dream home. Our furniture had been bought with the dark theme in mind and we were just so distraught at what happened.

The next few days we were met with total silence from Aragon. Jackie Chan had apparently come down with COVID the day after our walkthrough (this was not mentioned to us at all between the walkthrough and our completion date the next week). No one at Aragon had been working on a solution for us at all, and our completion date was fast approaching. We had gone as far as calling anyone we could reach at the Aragon office since no one had returned our communications. Finally, when our realtor contacted them to ask for an update, we were sent an offer to cancel the entire deal by a different coordinator. I was speechless. At no point in our interaction with Jackie did we ever bring up the possibility of canceling. My partner and I had already ended the lease on our rental assuming the unit would be ready for us to move in. We suggested that the developer either arrange to have all the incorrectly installed cabinets to be replaced with the correct color theme, or that we be compensated for the cost to replace them ourselves, which would come to about $20,000. Aragon came back to offer us a second storage unit for free, a ‚Äúvalue of $7,500‚Äù and reminded us that if we do not complete, that we would be fined for breaching the contract.Although Aragon was absolutely correct in the breach of contract, this gave us little more than 2 days to consider their offer. I let them know of my rejection of their offer, and intention to complete as I have no other living arrangements. I also mentioned that this second storage unit is of no value to us (we barely use the one that came with the condo), and the alleged ‚Äúvalue‚Äù was far from compensatory for the mistake that was made.

On the day of completion, I received a call from Jackie and he had let me know that after talking to Lenny Moy, the owner and visionary of Aragon Properties, that they had made concessions to offer me ‚Äúfree rent for two years‚Äù of an adjacent parking spot in my parkade. The value of this offer was $2640 as the spot rents for $110 a month. They made sure to let me know that this was a free lease and that I would have to purchase the spot for $31000 should I wish. While the parking spot was more practical than a storage locker, this was still a very distant attempt at compensation. In my half awake state (he had called me at 9AM on my weekend), I thanked him for the call and continued in my slumber. When I woke up, I thought more about the offer that was made, and proceeded to craft an email detailing my dissatisfaction at their offer. I reiterated that my intentions were for Aragon to either replace the incorrect cabinets, or compensate me for the cost to replace them.Aragon stood firm on their offer and reiterated on email exchanges multiple times that ‚Äúafter entering a binding contract, a purchaser must complete or will be forced to pay late penalties or forfeit their deposit‚Äù and that they have no legal obligation to fix their mistake because ‚Äúthe Vendor may from time to time, in its sole discretion, or as required by any governmental authority, change, vary or modify the plans and specifications pertaining to the property‚Äù.

I couldn‚Äôt believe the terrible service I was receiving for the purchase of a condo. This was not a small purchase that I was nitpicking details on, this was my home that I would spend the better part of my time inside. Since our completion in late May, we have had little to no response from the developer. No one has even apologized for their mistake, nor has anyone offered to work with us on a solution. I had expected so much better service from Aragon. It amazes me that they won‚Äôt take accountability for a mistake made by someone in their team along the way. To this day, we are still waiting for Aragon Properties to give us as little as an acknowledgement that they made a mistake. I suspect that they can‚Äôt do that in the event I wanted to get litigious. I am in no financial state to sue Aragon Properties for breach of contract and breach of warranty. It is hard enough for me as a homebuyer in BC to balance the rising cost of living with my income. This mistake would have come at very little cost in comparison to Aragon‚Äôs finances, but for me and my partner it may be a decade of saving.

After I shared my story on my social media page as well as in the building home owners group on Facebook, I was surprised to see how many people in the last year have had horrible experiences with Aragon. Everyone I spoke with was complaining about Aragon not responding to deficiency repair requests and dragging their feet in fulfilling commitments. One previous owner at The Station in Port Moody told me that after he moved in, the building had major plumbing and heating issues. There was also repeated quality issues with the elevator at that building but Aragon denied responsibility until an independent company had been hired to verify that Aragon's work was poorly completed.A quick look at their recent Google reviews also shows that Aragon's reputation has taken a turn in a bad direction with many homeowners having had terrible after sale care. Essentially once Aragon has made your money, you are on your own regardless of their responsibility.¬†

I hope that everyone is able to share this story with more people in the Greater Toronto Area so that Aragon is not able to hurt new homeowners in our already difficult to enter market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/vnnp2k/developer_in_torontos_deplorable_business/,Developer in Toronto's deplorable business practices and are ignoring their homeowners deficiencies - Aragon Properties Ltd,Condo,69,52,0.92

We will see US CPI report this Tuesday. This past week, bond traders expected a bad CPI (i.e. inflation is not coming down as much as economists expect), and raised the yields across the board for US and Canada government bonds. Bond traders have been wrong before so let's wait and see. I think they are right this time. If they're right, expect a big drop in the stock market and mortgage rates to go up.

I don't agree with his logic (which is that the Canadian real estate market is healthy and strong, but sensationalized media headlines will cause prices to drop) or his solution (40-year mortgages).

However, the prediction is telling coming from someone who has a great deal of information about the true state of mortgages and who has a lot to lose if prices drop.

**Quotes from the article:**

""If the government doesn't respond before Canadians need to renew their mortgages at the current high rates, Mr. Haditaghi cautions that homeowners will buckle under the weight of unaffordable mortgage payments and runaway inflation within a few months.""

""He predicts that hardworking Canadians will have no choice but to put up their homes for sale well below what they owe to banks and mortgage companies. In turn, this would also harm the CMHC, other insurance companies, Banks and Trust companies, which would be facing mountains of claims and bad mortgage debt.""

xkff5h,TorontoRealEstate,1663790779.0,"Based on my research, I believe there are five phases the housing market will need to go through to complete its down cycle.  I am outlining them below.  This is a rehash of what I posted 10 days ago but this time with phases and their cues.  As of September 2022, we are still clearly in the early part of Phase 1.

**Phase 1**:  Interest rate will continue to rise causing more layoffs as business investments cost increases and consumer demand decreases. As demand cools so will inflation. Later in this phase, central banks will slow the pace and the size of interest rate increases (50 and 25 bps instead of 75 and 100 bps). **Housing prices will continue to deteriorate as interest rate increases**, however, for FTHB, it remains unaffordable.

**Phase 2:**  Inflation is contained to 2%. **Inflation at 2% is your cue** to know we're in phase 2.  Due to weakening demand, unemployment rate creeping up, and inflation dipping below 2%, central banks begin to cut interest rates by 0.25%. Even Powell has indicated in his Q&A today (Sept 21, 2022) that they plan to cut interest rates when inflation reaches 2.0-2.1%. Why?  I think they expect job layoffs and will try to cushion the recession.  The difference between this layoff and the 2020 layoff is that this time high salary workers (managers, high paying tech and finance workers) are affected. Stock market will rally to all time high due to interest rate cut and businesses trimming costs (last rally before the big 40-60% drop). **Despite interest rate falling**, **housing prices are still falling** due to weakening outlook and people's worry about their ability to pay their mortgage given mass layoffs.

**Phase 3:**  Recession! Deflation!  **Deflation is your cue** for phase 3.  Yes, as demand slows and layoffs abound, food, shelter and items in core CPI will go down.  Central banks will continue to cut interest rates at increasing size. Mass layoffs everywhere. High income earners are also laid off and are looking for work. **Even with increasing interest rate cuts, housing prices are still falling** due to layoffs and the banks tightening lending standards.

**Phase 4:**  Many (not all) redditors wishing for housing to crash will not buy due to 1) no job or 2) have job but fearing about job security. Out of fear, everyone is staying put, trying to survive a recession. Canadians reduced their debt to disposable income to a respectable ratio. Housing prices are finally bottoming out with prices going sideways; **house prices going sideways is your cue** for Phase 4. **FTHB should BUY at this phase**.  (Question: Are house prices are going sideways right now?  Answer: This is a small data point, and inflation hasn't been contained to 2% yet so any sideway in prices is just temporary.  We need phase 2 and phase 3 to come first before we're in this phase).

**Phase 5:**  As fear got almost too out of hand, some savvy investors with deep pockets will scoop up cheap houses. Housing will then stabilize as jobs are beginning to come back. Jobs coming back is your cue for Phase 5. **FTHB should also BUY at this phase**.

Again this is just my view.  One lowly opinion.  Anybody with an asshole has an opinion, and there are a lot of assholes. Take it with a grain of salt.

Edit: Adding charts to show that during an economic down turn, decreasing interest rates does not mean housing prices go up.  Sources: Federal Reserve Economic Data.   In Aug 2007, when US Fed started to decrease interest rate from 5.25%, median US house prices were $241,800.  By December 2008, with subsequent decreases in interest rates to 0%, median US house prices were $208,400.

The truth is that the current regulations are so heavily imbalanced in favor of tenants, less and less landlords want to deal with tenants, because they are literally helpless when a tenant refuses to pay, or to move out, or trashes the property and leaves. This is the reason why rents are skyrocketing -- it is too risky to be a landlord, big or small.

And this is why it is so hard to rent anything -- every landlord is scared to have a bad tenant in, so they are being overly cautious about tenant applications

Elsie Kalu says¬†the ordeal led to her losing her job, plus she is now at risk of getting kicked out of her rental and faces¬†threats of foreclosure ‚Äî losing her property to the mortgage lender. She is begging Ontario's Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) to grant her a hearing so she can state her case to evict her tenant and finally move into the home she bought

Remember folks, roughly 37% of mortgage holders renewing in 2023.

Overleveraged, negative cash flowing, and underwater speculators will only be able to sustain so much pain.

11o4mrc,TorontoRealEstate,1678491562.0,"Genuinely curious - what is your serious rationale for expecting housing prices to continue increasing YoY?

If a FTHB in Toronto is looking at an $800k 500sqft condo, @ a 5.5% rate, it would be approx. $5k/month + maintenance fees, etc. - so >$6k/month. And this would be the entry point for a FTHB! You would need a gross yearly income of $200k, for this monthly payment to be 60% of your monthly net (I suppose a relatively comfortable living). 

So considering the current average wages, how can you think $7k/month, $8k/month, etc. in the coming years would be possible? For semis, $10k/month? 

Sure moving from $2k -> $3k/month or $3k/month -> $4k/month was difficult throughout the past 10-15 years with the growing housing prices, but it was *possible* because it meant moving from maybe 30-40% of your net income to maybe 50-60% of you net income - but what happens when monthly payments are 80-90% of net income for the majority of the population?

I suppose my question is - isn't there a ceiling of how high pricing can theoretically go before it's just actually unaffordable for 99% of people, and 99% stop buying? (\*Including renting!)

2. The owners upgraded all electrical. (When I reviewed it I found that only panel has been upgraded to a circuit breaker but the wires are still the old glass fuse black wires.) I then found a secondary electrical panel not too far away that was still the older glass fuses. 
3. He said the washroom has been upgraded (no shut of valves at the sink/shower, no GFI plugs by the sink) he didn't know what I was talking about when I pointed this out. Same went with the kitchen, no shut of valves and no GFI by sink. 
4. He promoted his property management company while I was there as I told him I have some rental properties. I asked him if he charged a fee over the cost of calling in a trades staff...he said he didn't know 
5. He asked me how much I would offer on this house and I pointed out that it does need work to make this into a decent rental or AirBNB.  I asked him how low his clients can go now. He said $15,000 less. I told him that I now know they will be in a difficult spot soon how low can they really go?

Since 2017 so-called multiple-property owners have been the largest group of buyers of Ontario real estate, but a new report analyzing the holdings of this cohort suggests they may become far less active as interest rates continue to rise.

In the spring Teranet, the private company that runs Ontario‚Äôs land registry system, reported that between 2017 and 2021 multiple-property owners purchased 22 per cent of all residential properties (detached houses, condominium units, semis, townhouses, etc.). The trend continued to accelerate in 2022, with more than 25 per cent of all residential properties in Ontario being purchased by multiple owners. In its third-quarter market insights report Teranet coloured in those figures by showing 53 per cent of them own only two properties. Those with three properties numbered 18 per cent, those with four were just 8 per cent.

However, the second largest cohort of multiple-property owners are the 21 per cent who own five or more residential properties.

The 2021 census data shows 1,253,238 private dwellings in Toronto and Teranet reports 29 per cent are owned by those who own multiple properties, which adds up to more than 363,000 residences.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/y9t8jl/multipleproperty_owners_are_facing_rising/,"Multiple-property owners are facing rising interest rates, especially in Toronto‚Äôs condo market",News,59,68,0.93

I follow this sub and news closely and it seems like I caught the peak and the home prices might fall 30%. People on this sub  keep criticizing durham and saying burbs are done . I  can‚Äôt help but think what if I waited for a year and got the same  home for a million ? I am 31 and would love to hear some positive experiences from folks out there. Thanks in advance .
Edit : fixing some grammar

Edit 2: Thank you to everyone who had kind words to say and wisdom to share . What I have realized reading all the amazing responses is that I might have overpaid 100k to buy this house but I guess I will be ok long term . No one knows the future . People keep waiting for that elusive bottom and get priced out . It‚Äôs better to buy something u love when u can afford it . Bigger remorse would be buying something cheaper that I didn‚Äôt love as a compromise . Also , to anyone who is trying to get into the market now - follow what Warren buffet says - ‚Äúbe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful‚Äù .

At first it was that interest rates are going up, and just wait until summer. Prices came down off the peak, but nothing meaningful compared to even a year ago. Then it was wait until fall, then wait until winter, and now it's wait until next year.

After the brief dip, prices have stabilized for the past 3 months, and have even started to increase. This includes even the suburbs, where everyone called for doomsday after how much those properties increased during the pandemic.

Recent data in the U.S. is showing that inflation is starting to ease (although still high) -- which is more of a reason for rate hikes to ease. And we all know which side the politicians are on, which is why it wasn't surprising on the timing of their immigration announcement.

yzovxs,TorontoRealEstate,1668899500.0,"Sales in the GTA are down close to 50%. The summer/fall home sales seasons came and went without anything close to the volumes of last years. 

The way I see it, real estate in GTA is essentially dead for the next 2-4 years. Why?

1. Currently, inventory is low, and so prices remain elevated. However, this is only because homes at the margins are selling. Of course, there's always someone willing to buy at nearly any price if there is something that's selling. The homes selling at the margins are giving false confidence that prices have stabilized.

2. Spring 2023 inventory will be coming online and it'll have the compounding effect of the carryover from this year's inventory. This will cause actual price discovery as a wider swathe of sales will reveal the actual price of homes. The problem is that while I see inventory shooting up, I don't see sales following as financing won't be made any easier by 2023. 

3. Rates won't be reversing in '23. In fact, they'll likely continue climbing but at a slower pace. So, if home affordability was bad this year because financing was difficult, next year will be that much worse. 

4. 2023 will be the year of the layoffs. The coming recession will bring with it higher unemployment and widespread job cuts, especially from higher paying jobs. Just think about all the different industries related to credit that will take a hit by rising rates. Car sales will flatline, home sales will flatline and so to will furniture and major appliances. All these industries have a network of jibs that will become redundant as demand for credit dries up. 


Ultimately, unless inflation does a complete 180 and we manage to stave off a recession, rates will continue to climb and the economy will be severely bruised.

I too am unimpressed by what my industry has produced. Such is what you get when you have tiny barriers to entry and mass amounts of cheating on courses that are already too easy & simple to begin with. 

Secondly, and to the more important point, look what happens when you have the sort of demand that we have here coupled with historically low interest rates, like we‚Äôve had in the last few years. 

To even stand a chance at homeownership, you‚Äôre competing blindly with a two digit, or in extreme cases three digit number of other offers. Not an exaggeration. Those who remember the RED HOT markets of past years (early start of 2017,  early 2022 just last year) know what it‚Äôs like to live in that kind of environment, which is exactly what happens with super low interest rates and the kind of demand that we have here.

And for those who purchased a home through those kind of environment, you know exactly how much more opportune a market like this is for the average buyer. True, the rates make the monthly payments inordinately high. rates are extremely high. But what would be the alternative? It‚Äôs exactly what we were dying to cool down all of these years. 

What we have right now is a far more balanced market, where sellers eventually have to come to reality and buyers can choose a home they actually like, and be able to do a proper due diligence on it before locking into purchase. I would take this reality ten times out of ten against the other, given the choice. 

Anyhow, just my 2 cents, which again, is from what seems to be one of the most hated professions on the planet.

vvwboi,RealEstateCanada,1657473811.0,"Here‚Äôs the long and the short of it.  First the short.

We caught a Realtor cheating on our agent rating website.  We penalized them.  They had their lawyer send me a letter threatening legal action.  Our team‚Äôs livelihood depends on this.  What should I do?

A.  Ignore them.  See if they sue.

B.  Publish this threat on their profile and on social media.

C.  Hire a lawyer to send a reply.

D.  Some other idea?

**Here‚Äôs the long story.**

I‚Äôm Dave, the owner of Rate-My-Agent.com.  It‚Äôs a rating and review site for people to rate their Realtor, mortgage broker, or insurance agent.  It‚Äôs not a big business (we‚Äôre a team of 5), but we‚Äôre not in it for that.  

Last spring we discovered a Realtor in Winnipeg had a lot of suspicious reviews, so we investigated.  A lot of the reviews came from identical IPs and in Ontario.  So we asked the Realtor, ‚ÄòAre all these reviews real or is there a chance that someone other than the client posted them?‚Äô  This is their chance to be honest.

‚ÄòYes, they‚Äôre all legitimate and posted by the client‚Äôs themselves.  We did not post them.‚Äô

So we let the Realtor know that we have evidence that proves they were not legitimate and they are issued a penalty according to our policy.  There were 66 fake reviews that we could prove, so the penalty is 132 weeks of being ranked at the bottom with a red ‚ÄòWARNING‚Äô on their profile and a fine of $33,000 to be paid to a charity.  (They don‚Äôt get to choose the charity.  We find a local charity.)

Some context on the amount of the fine.  This agent had become top ranked and admitted to getting a lot of clients from our site.  The average commission on a deal is over $12,000.  So the agent made a lot more than $33,000 from this deceiving tactic.

It‚Äôs not over there.

They request a call, so I oblige.  I record the video call just in case.  On the call, the Realtor admits to hiring a company to submit reviews on behalf of the clients.  This is a clear violation as our rating form has a checkbox to confirm you are the person you say you are.

‚Äò**I declare that I am the person named above and this review is true. I consent to be contacted at my provided email if required for verification or legal reasons. I take legal responsibility for the content of my review.‚Äô**

Now, over a year later, I receive a letter from a lawyer representing this Realtor threatening legal action.

**‚ÄòWe request that you submit immediately to us a draft of a clear and unqualified apology to be sent to (Realtor Name).  Additionally, we demand that you immediately take down the post in question and post a message specifying that the warning was published in error.  Further, we demand that you restore our client‚Äôs true ranking on the website as well her badges and terminate the penal fine to be paid.‚Äô**

What should I do?

10b102c,TorontoRealEstate,1673632916.0,"The central bank promised low interest rates would last ‚Äî then hiked them aggressively. A new report says the Bank‚Äôs messaging helped nudged borrowers toward variable-rates mortgages that many homeowners now regret.

‚ÄúYou can be confident that interest rates will be low for a long time.‚Äù

Bank of Canada governor Tiff Macklem will forever wear those words, spoken in October 2020, according to a new report from TD‚Äôs chief economist.

Macklem‚Äôs message, delivered at a time when the central bank was trying to project calm and stimulate the economy with ultralow interest rates amid the disruption of the pandemic, was aimed at businesses considering new investments and ‚Äúhousehold(s) considering making a major purchase.‚Äù

The result, said TD‚Äôs Beata Caranci, included an astonishing rush of Canadians into variable-rate mortgages, which offered much lower rates than fixed-rate loans at the time. By January of last year, 57 per cent of new mortgages were variable-rate, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, up from just six per cent in December 2019.

But little more than a year after Macklem‚Äôs reassuring words, the Bank of Canada began aggressively raising rates in a bid to combat inflation ‚Äî a move that came too late, according to Caranci.

Now, with the Bank‚Äôs central policy rate at 4.25 per cent, many are regretting those variable-rate loans as they face ever-higher monthly payments while struggling to absorb rising costs on everyday items such as food.

Variable-rate mortgages now account for about a third of total mortgage debt, the central bank said in November, up from about 20 per cent pre-pandemic.

People are ultimately responsible for their own financial decisions, Caranci told the Star in an interview, but the Bank of Canada‚Äôs words added fuel to the housing market fire.

‚ÄúIt led people down that path (toward taking on variable-rate mortgages) more than should have been the case,‚Äù she said, adding that the Bank‚Äôs original messaging indicated major rate increases wouldn‚Äôt happen until at least 2023.

‚ÄúI think where people got caught was the speed of increases. Even if people had anticipated rates would go up, they would not have anticipated the speed of increases, because we had not had a recent historical precedent of that.‚Äù

On top of its messaging, Caranci also critiqued the Bank for leaving rates so low for so long, particularly in the face of Canada‚Äôs high levels of immigration, with most newcomers settling close to five large urban centres and putting upward pressure on home prices in those areas.

While the Bank doesn‚Äôt set immigration levels, she said those low rates, maintained long after the worst of the crisis had passed, helped fuel ‚Äúhome prices, speculative behaviour, and leverage.‚Äù

‚ÄúBy mid-July (2021), they should have been thinking, ‚ÄòHey maybe we don‚Äôt need zero, letting (the policy rate) sit at one per cent for six months at this stage makes sense,‚Äô‚Äù she said, noting that would still have had a stimulative effect on the economy and at the same time, ‚Äúautomatically would have started to influence people‚Äôs decisions on what to do for financing.‚Äù

Caranci‚Äôs report said the Bank‚Äôs policies contributed to ‚Äúan injection of historic levels of household debt.‚Äù Now, that risk is about to be compounded by eye-popping costs to service those debts, taking away from Canadians‚Äô disposable income and likely hurting growth in other parts of the economy.

The damage is done now, but Caranci said when it comes to future financial crisis events, the Bank should be more careful with its messaging and less wedded to keeping interest rates ultralow over an extended period of time.

‚ÄúForward guidance and a bias toward a longer duration on the (low interest rates) gave an additional boost to the Canadian economy, but it also amplified risks and contributed to the central bank reversing course on interest rates at a breakneck pace in its aftermath,‚Äù she said in the report.

> * The latest survey, conducted in partnership with the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago‚Äôs Booth School of Business, suggests the Federal Reserve is a long way from ending its campaign to tighten monetary policy.

## Toronto‚Äôs Suburbs Cost 3x More Than New York City‚Äôs Suburbs

If you‚Äôre in a suburb and willing to commute for 10 to 30 minutes, prices change dramatically. About 20-30 minutes from downtown Toronto, sans traffic, you can buy in Mississauga for C$1,028,500. It‚Äôs where the region‚Äôs international airport is, and you‚Äôre likely to get more bang for your buck.¬†

In contrast, Newark is a suburb about 20-30 minutes from Manhattan. The median sale price was C$396,416 (US$310,750) in April, falling 4% just in the month. It also happens to be home to one of the region‚Äôs international airports.¬†

Sure, but when you buy into Toronto or Vancouver real estate ‚Äî you‚Äôre buying into an opportunity. Remember, you‚Äôre paying a lot more for future potential. What‚Äôs that? The gross domestic product (GDP) of Greater New York (C$2.42 trillion) is larger than Canada‚Äôs entire GDP (C$2.12 trillion)? Well, damn.

One major reason for my negative outlook is the persistent inflation. Even with rate hikes, inflation will not come down easily. They might not fall down below 4% mainly due to excess liquidity and the insatiable demand of consumers.

Just thinking out loud post.

My husband and I are saving our best to buy a house in the GTA area in the next couple of years (upgrade from DT condo to Semi-detached or Detached house).

We prefer not living in a condo anymore mainly because

1. Toronto condo maintenance fee is beyond its control compared to any other city in Canada. We realized that living in Condo in Toronto is still considered a ""hassle-free luxury lifestyle."" which inflate its maintenance fee a lot over the years to meet its resident's desire. We don't need any amenities or excessive heating. just want a simple life.
2. We are planning a family in near future. so need more bedrooms. and in the worst case, we can convert our house to a duplex or triplex so our kid can at least have their own place later.

I can cry all about How expensive Toronto real estate market is and how unfair it is for the younger generations like us etc for days but at the end of the day, we still need to adapt to this reality.

Anyway, Since we know that we will spend like $5000 per month or more for a mortgage for the next 25-30 years, our house would be the single most important asset/investment of our lifetime realistically speaking.

But the economic outlook is not that bright for Canada. The Housing and COL crisis in Ontario/Toronto doesn't seem to go away which drives away many potential residents as well as current residents. The government is useless but opponent parties are not providing any valid solution other than complaining (the only exception is the green party IMO but we know they don't have any chance..)Even we -a high-income households -  feel like we are barely surviving.

I am not so convinced that investing $5000 per month in the future Toronto housing market is the right decision.

It talks about how Toronto is missing mid-size apartments causes a disparity in the affordability of rental apartments/housing. This has been due to zoning that began in 1912 to restrict apartments. We are now stuck between high rises that are too expensive and small to rent for low to mid-income families and detached homes that are also too expensive to rent or buy. This leads to whatever rentals are appropriate to be high in cost too.

vssffj,TorontoRealEstate,1657120693.0,"From pre-pandemic (Feb 2020) to peak (Feb 2022), detached homes in the GTA have increased by 65%, whereas condos in the GTA have increased by 25%.  Detached homes have led the price increase, while the condos have lagged behind.  This is not unique to this accelerated price increase period as it has repeated the same pattern for the 2017 period and others in the past.  As the market peaked, detached homes have shown to quickly lose their value while condos hold their value (decrease or increase a little). For those looking to upgrade their condos to detached homes, it seems prudent to wait until the price multiple of detached to condo is below 1.8, or until the nominal price difference is less than $500K.  At this recent peak, the price multiple was 2.3 while the price difference was close to $1M.  Now, the price multiple is 1.95 while the price difference is $700K.

It is close to getting delivered. We just had a design 'consultation' which was not a consultation as the builder laid out the most plain and unattractive looking samples and beside them, put a few slightly nicer options with a crazy upcharge. But the interesting thing was, the samples that were available for us to choose from looking *nothing* like the design rendering that convinced us to buy the place in the first place. 

I know there is a clause in the APS that real life samples may not match the renderings and builders reserve the right to swap out items (as long as they are not lower quality). But it felt like they pulled out the cheapest quality items out there that looked nothing like the rendering in terms of style, colour, shape... anything!

They are only giving us dated and traditional looking items whereas the home was advertised as modern and luxury.  

Does this happen in pre-cons frequently? I have bought a condo years ago and everything was expected. The design we saw in the advertising brochure is what we ended up getting. But that was a for a small pre-con condo about 8-9 years ago. 

I'm very surprised at this current builder who kept insisting that renderings mean 'nothing' and kept repeatedly telling us to not look at the renderings.  I don't understand how this is remotely legal to completely swap out an entire design on a buyer?

Forget the renderings, they kept forgetting what they put in their own APS. We're having to repeatedly point out to ensure we get what we paid for. 

All in all, don't go for pre-cons people. The whole process with this builder had been nothing but taxing. And you never know what you're going to end up with.

This is a rant and a general warning about how builders behave and to unsuspecting buyers to not get swayed by what they see in brochures.

Edit: One day I will blast them when I don't care about their reputation tanking. Not today.

They charged me 15k extra when I bought so we get the 'upgraded' package. 2 years down the line, there seems to be another upgrade on top of upgrade. 

I'm not asking for any of the decorative items in the rendering. But say the kitchen seemed to have modern cabinetry with sleek handles. The option presented to us is a very unsightly looking dated cabinetry of a completely different colour with rickety looking knob pulls. 

I am just kind blown that they can completely swap things out on you but have the audacity to advertise their property as 'modern luxury'. 

They didn't even have the same exterior brick colour as the rendering. We had to choose a different one.

However the more I think about it and look at the data it seems like we have hit resistance in pricing decline.  I have even heard some of the major bears on twitter etc comment on this and say they don't understand it but immediately brush it off.  

Prices have been somewhat flat for 3ish months now.  From some quick math, it seems like prices have dropped almost exactly enough to keep monthly payments about equal to where they were at the price peaks.  5 year yield has been fairly stable and BOC will hike a bit more to take variable rates higher.  I am starting to think that we have seen the quick haircut and now any further declines will be a long slow process (if they happen).

For those who are very bearish even from here, what's the catalyst/driver for the next leg down?  Barring a very deep recession with mass layoffs I am having a hard time seeing it.  I am starting to lean towards the idea that ""affordability"" is not going to improve in Canada at all but basically prices will correct to account for higher monthly payments, which it seems like it is almost where we are now?

ydxzdr,TorontoRealEstate,1666790432.0,"**Affordability:**

At the February peak, a borrower was looking at a detached home in the GTA for $1.5M. 20% deposit gives $300k. Mortgage amount was $1.2M. 30 year amortization.  The best 5 yr fixed rate was 1.8%.  The monthly payment was $4316.

Today, that detached home of $1.5M on average should have dropped 24.4%, or is now $1.134M.  Same $300k deposit, same 30 yr amort.  The special rate at TD today is 5.54%.  The monthly payment would be $4756.  The monthly payment is $440 more, but you get a $366,000 discount.

Because condos haven't dropped much, affordability is much much worse than detached.

&#x200B;

**Worst case buyer (peak market, lowest interest rate):**

The worst case buyer is one who bought at peak in February, and because prices were so high, many buyers would need go variable or they simply believe interest rates will stay flat for a very long time.  Same scenario, detached home $1.5M, 20% deposit, mortgage $1.2M, 30-yr amort.  Variable 1.5% (let's just use this number even though I heard some got as low as 1.3%).  For this borrower, the trigger rate would hit around 4.14% because at this interest rate, all payments go towards the interest and none towards the principal.

w2ysmn,TorontoRealEstate,1658252923.0,"At the February peak, a borrower was looking at a detached home in the GTA for $1.5M. 20% deposit gives $300k. Mortgage amount was $1.2M. 25 year amortization.  Variable rate was 1.5% (overnight rate was 0.25%).  The monthly payment was $4800.

|Variable rate|Monthly Payment|Payment Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.5% (lowest rate)|$4800|$0|
|2%|$5086|\+$286|
|2.5%|$5383|\+$583|

|5.5%|$7369|\+$2569|
|6%|$7732|\+$2932|
|6.5%|$8102|\+$3302|

As the interest rate increases, the total monthly payment on a variable rate mortgage does not change but a higher proportion of the payment goes towards the interest and a lower proportion of the payment goes towards the principal\*\*.  What this means is that at the end of your 5 year variable mortgage term, the outstanding mortgage balance will be higher than originally projected.  What is wickedly mean is if the variable rate rises above 4.8%, all $4800 will go towards the interest.  Above 4.8% variable rate, not only all $4800 goes towards the interest, the principal grows!

Let's do housing affordability. Using the above scenario for a borrower who can put down $300k and can afford to pay $4800 per month, what a borrower can afford at various variable rates.

|Variable rate|Affordable house price|Price difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1.5% (lowest rate)|$1.500M|$0|
|2%|$1.432M|\-$68K (-4.5%)|
|2.5%|$1.370M|\-$130K (-8.7%)|
|3%|$1.312M|\-$188K (-12.5%)|
|3.5%|$1.259M|\-$241K (-16.1%)|
|4%|$1.209M|\-$291K (-19.4%)|
|4.25% (current special rate)|$1.186M|\-$314K (-20.9%)|
|5%|$1.121M|\-$379K (-25.3%)|
|5.5%|$1.082M|\-$418K (-27.9%)|
|6%|$1.045M|\-$455K (-30.3%)|

The good news for buyers is that despite interest rate rising, buyers can still afford the same house because the house price has dropped comparably the same as what the buyers can afford.

*\*\*From TD mortgage website:*

*Like with any TD variable rate mortgage, your interest rate will fluctuate with changes to the TD Mortgage Prime Rate, but the amount of your principal and interest payments will stay the same.*

*If TD Mortgage Prime Rate goes down, more of your principal and interest payment will go toward paying down your principal. If the TD Mortgage Prime Rate goes up, more of your payment will go toward paying the interest*

Edited: At 4.8%, all payments will go towards interest.  Above 4.8%, principal starts to grow.

vzwbfk,TorontoRealEstate,1657911475.0,"Long Post - Diving into current state of real estate

In the recent days, I have been seeing a lot of posts on reddit and twitter complaining about the interest rate hikes and the Bank of Canada's decision and its impact on Canadian real estate. Shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic due to various factors apart from low interest rates and access to easy credit many people engaged in what I would consider speculative buying but I think mass majority bought homes during this period due to access to cheap credit. Politics aside, I think the actions carried out by the BoC in response to the Covid-19 pandemic was required and necessary to avoid a massive financial depression given the lockdowns. In retrospect, I truly believe that the BoC and other Central Banks around the world didn't expect that we would be facing inflation and commodity shortages within a short period of time given what Japan has been doing for the past 40 years. I think the lockdowns around the world is what exacerbated this and for the most part if the Bank of Canada did all the right moves possible in terms of fiscal policy we would still be in a bad situation as we are living in a global economy. Everyone around the world is facing supply chain issues to some extent some worse and some better. 

Now tying this back to real estate, again the reason behind this post is based on what I have seen all over social media especially twitter and reddit. One of which was a tweet from John Pasalis of Realosophy who quoted Macklem from July 2020 saying that ""you can be confident that rates will be down for a long time"" and further tweeting that ""As they hike by a full 1% today & are destroying household budgets & driving down the value of homes people just bought...  Hopefully they'll never again make promises they can't keep"". As mentioned before I truly think this was the intention however the economy is not that simple and nothing can be fully forecasted in the economic models used to drive these financial decisions. However what I find outrageous about this tweet is the fact that interest rates were expected to rise in 2023 and back to normalcy in 2024, so what real difference would that have made. I would argue that if the BoC didn't raise now and followed through with their promise, CAD will be weaker adding to inflation pressure and the speculative behavior in real estate would have continued.  

Hypothetically say the house prices were stagnant after February 2022 and the BoC did not start raising rates until 2023 and 2024, would that not impact the household budgets not to mention, the prices of goods and services already being high from a weak CAD and inflationary pressures. Secondly, in terms of driving down the value of homes people just bought, the moment a house is bought, the value of the house is already down factoring transaction costs (commission, land transfer, lawyer fees and other moving costs) and if real estate is a long-term game like most real estate bulls preach then why does it even matter if home prices are down. Finally, the BoC and the rest of the Western Central Banks did bring interest rates to lower bound and did promise it will be low until 2023 however they did not insinuate people to speculate and over-leverage themselves.

Another Real Estate Furu, Steve Sarestsky posted on twitter in December 2021 that he secured a variable rate of 1.2% and thanked Tiff Macklem, he further publicly broadcasted that the BoC can't raise interest rates by more than 3 hikes and mocked CIBC economists for saying 8 hikes by 2023. Encouraging speculative behaviors to his audience and saying rates will be low and BoC can't raise rates cause we have a high debt to GDP ratio. Now he pivots 365 and says that he's so sure that interest rates will be cut in 2023 and not to worry. This is the speculative behaviour that got us in this place to begin with. 

The problem is not higher interest rates, the problem is people over-extending themselves and participating in speculative behavior believing prices only go up. The people who bought in the last 18 months who are complaining about interest rates did not focus on the full picture of buying a home including their payments when interest rates do go up and how to manage for the future. They need to ask themselves why was this not considered, was this information withheld or ignored. People in this country need to stop sensationalizing realtors and seeking financial advice from them especially when you are making the biggest purchase of your life. Realtors are there to sell, and are only there until the point of sale and not in the business of looking after your financial well-being after the sale. Also if you did buy in the last 18 months consider if your realtor mentioned this. Finally media plays a big role, be careful in the media you consume and if you did do your own research and consumed a wide variety of financial media this would've been easily avoided.

Realtors on this sub-reddit and in general are so defensive when people say they are part of the problem but I just pointed out two realtors with a big social following and media credibility who had shows on Yahoo Finance and regularly appear on BNN Bloomberg and other media outlets, so what does that say? I would say 90% of realtors would fall in this category as self-interests drive their decision-making, again I am not saying that people shouldn't be buying through a realtor but what I am saying is most realtors don't know how the macro-economy works and do not seek financial advice from them. Realtors are sales people and they should focus on getting the best deals not providing financial advice, and for those who need handholding when making a purchase.

11aj0ob,TorontoRealEstate,1677214852.0,"I think, **RE pumps / bulls is a phenomenon of ZERO interest rates**. With raising rates and rates staying high for extended period of time, these RE pumps will soon become extinct species.

&#x200B;

Here is a detailed explanation with some charts:

We all agree that near-zero interest rates have contributed to the growth of real estate pumps in Toronto and other parts of Canada. This has led to rapid price increases driven by speculation and investment, and has contributed to a cycle of bidding wars and the fear of missing out (FOMO) among buyers. Especially, during 2021/22. There are tons of FOMO buyers.

&#x200B;

[House prices started sky-rocketing after BoC dropped mortgage rates.](https://preview.redd.it/7zxbwp8b22ka1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e30f22571d101655fa916bcffea407b42a3fabd)

&#x200B;

However, in a high mortgage rates era, the cost of borrowing money to purchase a home increases. This can lead to a decrease in demand for homes and a reduction in bidding wars, potentially contributing to a slowdown in price growth and a decline in home values. This is what we have been seeing once BoC started mortgage hikes party.

&#x200B;

Below is an example where $5000 monthly mortgage payment is able to pay $1.3M mortgage at 1%, where as the same $5000 is able to pay just $700K at 7% mortgage rates.

https://preview.redd.it/2ubtzquag2ka1.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fe3f416b5d9e59883d6b776c0b4c2dfb04359e2b

Rising interest rates can also make it more difficult for existing homeowners to afford their mortgage payments, potentially leading to an increase in defaults and foreclosures. Especially those on variable rate mortgages. There were few pumps in this forum, who recommended their clients to go for variable rate mortgages just before BoC started mortgage hikes party. This increased mortgage rates has put downward pressure on home prices and exacerbated the decline in demand for homes.

&#x200B;

Buyers who enter the real estate market during periods of FOMO-driven price growth may overextend themselves financially and potentially put themselves at risk of financial hardship if home prices decline. We have been seeing tons of such FOMO buyers who are paying their tuition fee dues. I  sympathize their losses, but all I can offer is a graduation certificate!

&#x200B;

Overall, while the low interest rate environment has contributed to the growth of real estate pumps, it is important to realize that high mortgage rate era going to cause lot of hardships for overextended home owners, especially those who are overleveraged (via HELOC, multiple speculative properties that negative cashflow etc). These will be paying tuition fees at an accelerated rate. Congratulations!

&#x200B;

Moreover, majority of precons are booked by investors intending to flip over to next bigger fool. These will be paying cool tuition of forfeiting their deposits.

&#x200B;

Here is chart the explains how Canada house prices are unhinged from fundamentals due to the decade long low mortgage rates.

Here is a chart the better describes what is going to happen if high mortgage rates: House prices going to revert to 2014 prices (or even lower).

&#x200B;

To summarize:

RE pumps/bulls in Canada is just phenomenon of zero mortgage rates. As we will NOT be seeing those low rates in next 5-10 years, we can safely declare that **RE pumps will soon become extinct species** during this decade long winter of Canada housing.

‚ÄòA month ago, bidding wars between as many as 20 potential buyers were common for his listings in Vancouver. Now, occasionally only a single offer turns up‚Äô

‚ÄòRealtors and economists alike see a shifting tide after Canada‚Äôs home prices surged by more than 50 per cent over the past two years. Higher mortgage rates are pulling down purchasing power just as politicians are piling on measures to rein in the market‚Äô

‚ÄúWe could see some outright price declines,‚Äù said Robert Hogue, a senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. He says markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the country's two most-expensive cities, could post ‚Äúsingle-digit declines‚Äù in the second half of the year.‚Äô

‚ÄòThe same forces that fueled the nation‚Äôs pandemic housing boom ‚Äî record low interest rates and a demand for larger living spaces ‚Äî have done the same thing in the U.S. and many developed countries. What makes Canada unique is the ratio of home prices to incomes is stretched, after rising at a quicker pace than other markets. That may make it the first place where the global shift towards higher interest rates starts to bite‚Äô

‚ÄòWhen interest rates rise, ‚Äúthe price to clear the market suddenly needs to drop back to what a median household can afford,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where we have potential for what I‚Äôd describe as almost like an air pocket ‚Äî where prices have surged so much, there‚Äôs potential for them to gap down to find where buyers are able to come in.‚Äô

‚ÄúThe spring market happened in February this year,‚Äù said Tom Storey, a broker who works in Toronto. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not seeing every house that sells on the street, or every condo that sells in a building, sell for more than the last comparable. You‚Äôre starting to see some sell under.

Reza Sabour, a mortgage broker in Vancouver, says buyers have already seen their purchasing power drop about 10 per cent over the past month or so.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely going to be shock waves if rates continue like this,‚Äù he said.

10qdhdg,TorontoRealEstate,1675206400.0,"Every mortgage holder is ecstatic because BoC has indicated a pause in rate hikes, and they now feel that the rates cut will start by the end of 2023. Both these things are not going to happen. In fact, BoC will have to hike the rates again later this year and will not cut the rates well into 2024. Why? Because of the below reasons:

**China**

One of the main reasons why inflation come down in Q2 of 2022 was because of lower oil/gas prices. This reduction in prices was not because of the rate hikes (as thought by many of my friends and family members) but due to China going in a Covid zero lockdown in Mid-March that persisted till Oct/Nov 2022. This [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/china/china-2022-zero-covid-intl-hnk-mic/index.html) gives the timeline (on a high level) when the lockdowns started (in Shanghai) that then spread to the rest of the country. After significant protests, China started opening up only in Dec 2022.

Now compare that time frame (March to Dec 2022) with this [chart of Gas prices in Canada](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1293131/canada-daily-average-gas-prices/). The gas prices were highest in June due to uncertainty of Ukraine war but fell at a brisk pace due to additional availability of crude oil due to China‚Äôs lockdowns.

Now that China has moved away from the zero covid lockdowns and is planning on opening up fully, the price of oil is going to go up and it‚Äôs effect on inflation is highlighted in [this Dec 2022 Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-re-opening-j-curve-oil-consumption-2022-12-13/). The same sentiment is echoed in [BNN Bloomberg‚Äôs article](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/the-world-s-next-big-inflation-surprise-is-looming-in-china-1.1876979) from yesterday (Jan 30th).

The current Canadian inflation rate of 6.32% might come down slightly in the next couple of months but will either be flat or increase, due to increased oil demand from China, by mid 2023. This increase in oil demand will cause price increases at the pump and higher cost of essential items as well, causing inflation to inch up.

**US economy and Canada importing from US**

As of today, the US has an extremely tight labour market and an inflation rate of 6.5% (for Dec 2022). Because of this, FED will keep hiking rates (albeit at a slower pace) till at least May 2023. If BoC has paused and FED keeps increasing the rates, then CAD will devalue against USD. This will make imports (oil and other goods) from the US costly.

So, in order to keep fighting inflation, BoC will have to hike rates in 2023 and keep them elevated for a certain period of time.

\- Bought a pre-construction condo back in July 2021

\- Interim occupancy date is mid-late 2024

\- Downpayment is \~120k spread over 4 payments (40k, 40k, 20k, 20k) and I've made 3 of the payments so far (\~100k)

&#x200B;

Recently, the developer has made amendments to my dwelling unit. It was initially on the 38th floor and now they have moved me to the 40th, but I'm not down for that.

I let them know I didn't want that and they gave me two options:

\- Proceed as is with the 40th floor

\- Mutual release agreement

&#x200B;

I opted for the mutual agreement since they were telling me I would get my entire deposit back. I week later, they messaged me saying that they would only give me \~65k back because of ""property value appreciation"".

What kind of bullshit is this? Seems like they are strong-arming me to take less money back or take a condo that they changed. **Does anyone have insight on if it's possible for me to take legal action against them?**

wqyamn,TorontoRealEstate,1660765827.0,"From pre-pandemic (Feb 2020) to peak (Feb 2022), detached homes in the GTA have increased by 65%, whereas condos in the GTA have increased by 25%. Detached homes have led the price increase, while the condos have lagged behind. This is not unique to this accelerated price increase period as it has repeated the same pattern for the 2017 period and others in the past. As the market peaked, detached homes have shown to quickly lose their value while condos hold their value (decrease or increase a little).

At this recent peak, the price multiple was 2.3 while the price difference was close to $1M. Now, the price multiple is 1.89 compared to June's 1.95, and the price difference is $643K compared to June's $700K. For those looking to upgrade their condos to detached homes, it seems prudent to wait until the price multiple of detached to condo is below 1.8, or until the nominal price difference is less than $500K.  Maybe November 2022 to January 2023 timeframe?

Looking for advice from more seasoned home buyers out there. As a FTHB we put in an offer on a property with a 3 day financing condition.

A home is listed for 1.6M with an offer date. This is a low-ball price designed to get a bunch of offers, encourage competition, and get someone to make an emotional offer.

In a candid moment, the seller‚Äôs agent admits they are looking for 1.8M. (In some other markets, believe it or not, they would have listed the house at 1.8M.)

The home does not sell. Presumably, the offers were <1.8M.

The home is re-listed for 1.9M. Now, I don‚Äôt know for sure, but my guess is that the agent‚Äôs game this time around is that they want a buyer to feel like they are getting a deal, by giving them a chance to offer less than asking. So they are still targeting 1.8M. It‚Äôs just another angle to try to get someone to overpay.

Knowing this kind of information can help you to make an informed offer‚Äîalong with relevant comps.

Wahi‚Äôs key insights from August 2002 include:

1. 92% of GTA neighbourhoods are now in underbidding territory (Aug 2022) vs 84% in July 2022 and 72% being in asking or higher in August 2021.¬†¬†
2. The median underbid has increased by 22% month over month to -$24,500 vs -$20,000 in July 2022 and a swing of -$40,450 vs Aug 2021.¬†
3. There are still 8% of neighbourhoods in overbidding territory - the top five are all in Ajax & Markham - common theme is median price is near $1M - likely first time home buyers trying to get a foothold in the market¬†are driving bidding activity.¬†
4. Four of five of the biggest underbidding neighbourhoods have a median list price above $2.5M - most expensive neighbourhoods taking the biggest pricing / bidding hit.

Anyone thinking they can avoid capital gains taxes this way is foolish, and needs tax advice from a professional.

y3z1ug,TorontoRealEstate,1665766188.0,"Nervous investors looking to offload their pre-construction condos in the secondary market may find themselves out of luck, industry watchers say, as a softening real estate market and rising interest rates send buyers to the sidelines.

A number of real estate agents in the Greater Toronto Area told the Financial Post they have been seeing a surge of calls asking about ‚Äúassignment sales,‚Äù a kind of legal transaction in which the original pre-construction condo buyer ‚Äúassigns‚Äù or transfers the rights and obligations of the purchase agreement to another buyer.Because pre-construction units have not been registered, such sales are not advertised on the MLS system, and comprehensive data on the market is limited.

But those in the industry say stagnating condo prices are making it more difficult for owners to exit their investments.

At Precondo.ca, an online catalogue of pre-construction units across the GTA, investor concern is evident in an increase in chatter about such sales.

The overall share of conversations with the intent to trigger an assignment sale jumped from four per cent in 2017 to 14 per cent this year, based on a sample of 78,000 calls that were screened for the use of the words ‚Äúassignment,‚Äù ‚Äúassign‚Äù or ‚Äúflip.‚Äù

Precondo.ca chief executive and co-founder Jordon Scrinko said he has never seen the assignment market this soft before.

‚ÄúWithin the past three to five years, there is a sizeable chunk of the market of the pre-construction buying pool, who bought units that may never actually intended to close on, and some of them ‚Äî even more worrying ‚Äî actually factually cannot afford to close on,‚Äù Scrinko said.

Scrinko added that if push came to shove, most of these buyers could afford to close, though they never intended to complete the sale and were hoping to flip the contracts for a profit. A more typical client, by contrast, might be forced to pursue the option because of a life event, such as job loss or divorce, or an inability to get financing as interest rates rise.

Timing will be a big factor in determining which of these investors will see a profit on their pre-construction purchases, Scrinko said.

‚ÄúIf they bought five years ago, they‚Äôre still in profit in nine out of 10 cases,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if they bought, say 2020 or end of 2019 and ‚Ä¶ the building‚Äôs coming up on occupancy today and they‚Äôre trying to flip that contract today ‚Äî in most cases, those people are not equity-positive.‚Äù

Those units are underwater because the prices for pre-construction condos, which used to sell below market rates, have in recent years soared due to rising construction costs, with units now commanding 10 to 20 per cent more per square foot than similar resale condos. With condo prices trading sideways over the past two years, the valuation gap has not closed.

Scrinko also noted interest in new pre-construction condos has been slowing down.

‚ÄúEarly this year, (around) January, February, March, if you launched a condo building, pretty much no matter where it was and no matter what the price was, the market would absorb it pretty quickly,‚Äù Scrinko said. ‚ÄúNowadays, it‚Äôs the complete opposite. It‚Äôs more of a balanced market where developers can‚Äôt expect, in most cases, to sell.‚Äù

Real estate organizations have also raised red flags about the pre-construction space recently. Re/Max‚Äôs Oct. 12 condominium report noted that pre-sale condo construction has been particularly challenged by the current environment.

‚ÄúBuilders who are too far invested are moving forward, but many of these buildings are now selling at $1,400 to $1,500 per square foot,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúThis, at a time when the resale market rate is $1,100 per square foot. Development costs alone have risen an estimated 18 to 22 per cent in the past year.‚Äù

GTA condo prices have been volatile over the past two years, moving from $630,047 in January 2020, peaking at an exuberant $808,566 in March 2022 before calming to $730,818 in the latest September data, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.

John Pasalis, president at Toronto-based Realosophy Realty, said trouble in the pre-construction condo market could have wider consequences.

‚ÄúThe idea, of course, is the second new housing sales and starts slow down, that ends up having a broader domino effect economically,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe lose jobs in the construction industry and housing fuels a significant section of our economy. So, there‚Äôs massive economic risks.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think the bigger effect would just be a turn to pessimism, and when people become pessimistic, you end up potentially with some more distress, some panic selling, and potentially more downward pressure on prices as well,‚Äù he added.

Pasalis wasn‚Äôt surprised by the number of investors looking to back out of deals since many of them are having a tough time getting financing given the impact of the stress test as interest rates rise.

The flight of investor capital from the condo segment could also weigh on new supply coming to market since fewer buyers would translate to fewer condo starts, he said.

A recent report from real estate research firm Urbanation Inc. found the Greater Toronto Area‚Äôs housing inventory reached crisis levels in the second quarter and that the pipeline of new supply was being disrupted. About 35,000 new condo units had been slated for launch this year but only 16,000 have made it to the finish line and fewer than 10,000 are expected throughout the rest of the year, suggesting 10,000 units will not be completed as planned.

Construction could be further disrupted, Pasalis said, if the dynamic that played out during the global financial crisis ‚Äî when some investors stopped making their deposits on condos that had become worth less than what they had originally paid ‚Äî reemerges.

‚Äú(This dynamic) could also impact construction buildings that are already in the pipeline,‚Äù Pasalis said. ‚ÄúNot to say that that‚Äôs going to happen, but it has bigger potential impacts beyond just seeing a lower number of housing starts.‚Äù

We had an ""opportunity"" to buy a new build in March 2022, closing in June 2023.
We decided that if we can sell our current home for x amount, we will go with this new house as we fully understand we are over paying and expect a market crash, the equity we are getting from our current home is worth the switch.
Called a few people around before listing to see if we can do a private sale and came to know of a family friend who was looking for a house in our area. They came and saw the house, liked it, and we made a deal the same day. They wanted August closing, we agreed.
Now the prices have obviously gone down a lot and he's been acting strange. 
We did all the right things, sold ours before we signed up for the new house, even when it meant living in rental for 1 year somewhere until our new house gets built as we didn't want to take market risk. I advised him to do the same at the time but he wanted to renovate his current house and sell it for higher prices, well it's not selling at all.
Now it's almost time for closing and he is asking me to ""do something"" in price and delay closing.

The price of sale is over 1 million and we do have decent equity in the house but we did sell for a reasonable market price in march as i didn't want to be greedy, just the number that we wanted.
Have a bad feeling about this. APS is non conditional and we have a 50k deposit but if they back out, we would be screwed. It would probably sell for 200k less now (if it sells) and we would be tight for the new house.

Should we negotiate with them or try to make them realize that it's a binding contract? Like, i don't think it's fair to us. I don't like the price we paid for the new house but we agreed to that price and I'll honor that, can't just call the builder and negotiate now. The builder would sue me immediately!

I have looked into judgements of real estate cases like this that end up in court and noticed that we are in a strong position legally, but wondering if it's worth the hassle of lawyering up in case things go south?

Thanks. 
ü•≤

Edit : after a long nightmare of a negotiation and persuasion, the house closed on the same day as agreed but with $40k less than the original price.

The truth of the matter is, DO NOT BUY INTO EITHER THE BULL OR BEAR NARATIVE. Fact is very simple; (1) market is down year over year, its going to be trading sideways for a bit BUT (2) prices, demand, competition and offers have ALL HAVE picked up month over month and compared to end of 2022. These two things can be true, and are true. No crash coming, no rocket ship coming either. Don't wait for another 20% drop in average prices, but do not buy into the FOMO either. Asses the numbers week by week, month by month, and consult a true professional for your particular property type or criteria.

**-legal description (ask your realtor to see the 'geowarehouse' report for full description. there can be nasty surprises here like utility easements)**

**-deposit (typically 5% of price)**

**-irrevocability (what time&date you are making your offer valid until)**

**-completion date (official closing date, shouldn't be a Friday or statutory holiday)**

**-chattels included (typically items like all kitchen appliances, washer/dryer, window coverings, light fixtures, etc. may include furniture depending on what is negotiated)**

**-rental items (if items such as furnace or hot water tank are rentals, the terms should be spelled out here)**

**-Schedule A (this one is important, adds terms, clauses and conditions that go beyond the basics and standard form copy. conditions like financing, inspection, and home inspection are written here. every realtor has their version of this schedule they like to use but important considerations should be noted here. things like how many times buyer can visit & other items not mentioned in the agreement)**

RE bulls were very adamant that interest rate would not increase in December and now will not increase in January, citing the 5Y bond yield has climbed down. But lo and behold, it has gone up 45 basis point. The market is very dynamic (i.e. changing frequently), so you shouldn't pick a small time frame window as evidence that rates will go a certain way. Likewise, now it has gone up 45 basis points, it doesn't mean much in terms of what the next rate hike will be. And as far as RE prices are concerned, interest rates at this point don't really matter. Currently, it's more than what people can afford for buying and for paying existing mortgage.

z98yd9,TorontoRealEstate,1669855443.0,"**News Release:**

The Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO), the Province‚Äôs realtor regulator, can do a better job protecting the interests of consumers in what is often one of the biggest purchases of their lives, says Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk in her 2022 Annual Report. RECO is legislated to protect consumers who buy properties 
in Ontario.

Despite its mandate to protect consumers, RECO‚Äôs Board of Directors is almost exclusively comprised of industry representatives. Its Board is required to have an advisory process for direct input to the Board on issues of importance to consumers, but for most of RECO‚Äôs existence, it has not had this process in place.

The Auditor‚Äôs report identified the following areas for improvement:

* Some legal protections imposed in other jurisdictions, such as the restriction on realtors representing both sides of a transaction, do not exist in Ontario, though they carry an inherent risk for consumers. 
Ontario also allows ‚Äúblind bidding‚Äù which prevents potential buyers from knowing the value of other bids, and there is no cooling off period to allow buyers to reconsider their purchase.

* RECO doesn‚Äôt have a policy that prevents a realtor from profiting on a transaction that violates its Code of Ethics, and fines for unethical transactions are often lower than a realtor‚Äôs sales commission.

* RECO does not have a consistent process to assess applicants who disclose a criminal history. The audit sampled 25 brokers and salespersons registered in the last three years who had disclosed a criminal 
conviction or charges. Even though RECO can refuse to register applicants who cannot be expected to carry on business lawfully and with integrity, in 20 of these cases, these registrations were approved, and RECO did not have a documented rationale for why it did not refuse to do so.

* RECO inspects real estate brokerages to assess their compliance with the Real Estate and Business Brokers Act. However, more than a quarter of real estate brokerages have never had a full inspection, and more than a third haven‚Äôt had a full inspection in more than five years.


In addition, Lysyk noted that it is probable that money laundering is occurring undetected in Ontario‚Äôs real estate market. Large cash transactions on real estate are rarely reported, even though it is required. FINTRAC, the federal agency tasked with tracking large cash transactions, received zero reports from Ontario realtors 
from 2017 to 2021 and just 18 reports in the following year. 
The audit report includes 25 recommendations for improvement.

**Some quotes from the report highlighted by Ben**

Re spot audits:

>""RECO has never performed a full
on-site inspection at 27% of registered brokerages, and has not conducted a full on-site inspection at a further 35% of brokerages in more than five years.""

Re criminal screening 

>""RECO does not have a formal policy, guide-lines or a consistent process to assess whether to refuse to register applicants who have a criminal history.""

Re the adequacy of fines as deterrents:

>"" we found that 67% of registrants were
fined a lower amount than the commission earned in the related real estate transaction.""

Re fraud/lack of controls in qualification exams:

>""...major breach in the integrity of exams
offered...RECO has not taken steps to independently verify whether the issues that led to the breaches have been satisfactorily addressed

Re inspection of brokerages

>""RECO does not review and monitor whether inspections of brokerages are carried out consistently and effectively""
>""proportion of inspections that identify instances of non-compliance...as high as 82%""
>BUT... ""rarely follows up""


Re money laundering:

>""FINTRAC received zero reports of large cash transactions between the 2017/18 and 2020/21 fiscal years, and just 18 reports of large cash transactions in 2021/22, from real estate brokers and salespersons.""

Re conflicts of interest

zekchd,TorontoRealEstate,1670366136.0,"I purchased my very first condo this spring and I've had nothing but regret. In the last 6 months, my neighbour's leaking HVAC has caused not one, but two floods into my bedroom resulting in $6k in damages. Both times, technicians set up 5 large drainage fans for 72 hours, which wreaked havoc on my sleep as a nurse. 

Since both floods were due to this neighbour's negligence, I asked her insurance to pay for my repairs. However, I was told that due to a waiver of subrogation, I had to go through my own insurance. FYI - we both use the same insurance provider. Anyway, I submitted a claim through my own insurance and had to pay a $1000 deductible. I was also told that if I ever submitted a second claim, I would be dropped as a client. Just like that. 

Lo and behold, the neighbour never fixed her HVAC and 2 months later, she flooded my condo for a second time. This time, I opted to pursue damages in small claims court, but I just received a letter from her lawyer (who happens to work for our shared insurance provider) that says due to the waiver of subrogation found in our condo declaration, I'm not allowed to sue a neighbour. I went back to my adjuster who once again confirmed that if I submitted a second flood claim, I would no longer be their client. 

So let me get this straight - even though both floods were confirmed to be caused by this neighbour, I'm not allowed to sue her for the damages, and if I make an insurance claim, I will now lose my insurance. In what world does this make sense? By this logic, can't she just continue to flood my condo with no consequences, indefinitely? 

Our condo declaration also states that the HVAC is the sole responsibility of the owner, and any damages to other units caused by failure of that owner to maintain their HVAC will be the responsibility of that owner. When I mentioned this to the neighbour's lawyer, he said the waiver of subrogation ""overpowers"" the section of our declaration that holds the neighbour responsible for the damage. The lawyer also stated that if I continue to pursue this case and it goes to trial, I will be responsible for his legal fees, which I cannot afford. I've reached out to a few lawyers myself, but I've been quoted $500-600/hr to review my condo declaration. 

I simply can't understand how a neighbour can destroy my unit not once, but twice, with no consequences, while I risk losing my own insurance due to her negligence? Not to mention how much more difficult it will be to find an affordable insurance provider with a lapse on my record. Is her lawyer just trying to strong arm me or do I stand no chance trying to sue?

If something were to happen tomorrow, such that the Fed drops interest rates like a stone again, I actually think this would be very bad for most Canadians. It would likely mean that real estate would naturally go stratospheric again, and Canadians would miss out on a real learning opportunity.

I believe in real estate as a good long term investment, but, I'm around a half century years old. My health might not hold out much longer. My dad worked hard, retired at 64, passed of cancer at 66.

Why would I willingly take a job, that requires me to work for 20 years, with no pay?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/11uwy3l/why_is_real_estate_in_the_us_so_much_easier_to/,Why is real estate in the US so much easier to cash flow than real estate in Canada?

Here are a few highlights from the data collected in the 2021 Census:

* The proportion of Canadian households that own their home‚Äîor the homeownership rate (66.5% in 2021)‚Äîis on the decline in Canada after peaking in 2011 (69.0%). The growth in the number of renter households (+21.5%) is more than double that of the number of owner households (+8.4%).
* Recently built dwellings are increasingly likely to be occupied by renters. Of the housing built in the five years ending in 2021, 40.4% was tenant-occupied, the highest tenant rate next to that of dwellings built in the 1960s post-war apartment boom, at 44.5%.
* The rising trend of condominium construction continues. The share of occupied dwellings that are condominiums edged up from 13.3% in 2016 to 15.0% in 2021. Most condominiums (90.0%) are located in Canada‚Äôs large cities, known as census metropolitan areas.
* Unaffordable housing rates are highest in downtown areas. In 33 of the 42 downtown areas of large urban centres, the percentage of renters spending more than 30% of their income on shelter costs in 2021 was above the national average.
* In 2021, almost 1.5 million Canadian households lived in core housing need (i.e., living in an unsuitable, inadequate or unaffordable dwelling and unable to afford alternative housing in their community). The core housing need rate fell from 12.7% in 2016 to 10.1% in 2021, driven largely by increased household incomes and improved housing affordability.

Voici quelques faits saillants provenant des donn√©es recueillies dans le cadre du Recensement de 2021 :

* La proportion de m√©nages canadiens qui √©taient propri√©taires de leur logement, soit le taux de propri√©t√© (66,5 % en 2021), est en baisse au Canada apr√®s avoir atteint un sommet en 2011 (69,0 %). La croissance du nombre de m√©nages locataires (+21,5 %) est plus du double de celle du nombre de m√©nages propri√©taires (+8,4 %).
* Les logements construits r√©cemment sont de plus en plus susceptibles d‚Äô√™tre occup√©s par des locataires. : 40,4 % des logements construits au cours des cinq ans se terminant en 2021 √©taient occup√©s par des locataires, ce qui repr√©sente le taux de locataires le plus √©lev√© apr√®s celui des logements construits lors de l‚Äôessor des appartements d‚Äôapr√®s-guerre dans les ann√©es 1960 (44,5 %).
* La tendance √† la hausse de la construction de copropri√©t√©s se poursuit. La part des logements occup√©s en copropri√©t√© a l√©g√®rement augment√©, passant de 13,3 % en 2016 √† 15,0 % en 2021. La plupart des copropri√©t√©s (90,0 %) se trouvent dans les grandes villes du Canada, appel√©es les r√©gions m√©tropolitaines de recensement.
* Les taux de logements inabordables sont les plus √©lev√©s dans les centres-villes. Dans 33 des 42 centres-villes des grands centres urbains, le pourcentage de locataires qui consacraient plus de 30 % de leur revenu aux frais de logement en 2021 d√©passait la moyenne nationale.
* En 2021, pr√®s de 1,5 million de m√©nages canadiens ont √©prouv√© des besoins imp√©rieux en mati√®re de logement, c.-√†-d. qu‚Äôils vivaient dans un logement qui √©tait inabordable, de taille non convenable ou de qualit√© inad√©quate et ne pouvaient se permettre un autre logement dans leur collectivit√©. Le taux de besoins imp√©rieux en mati√®re de logement a diminu√©, passant de 12,7 % en 2016 √† 10,1 % en 2021, principalement en raison d‚Äôune hausse du revenu des m√©nages et d‚Äôune meilleure abordabilit√© du logement.

xgwqxv,TorontoRealEstate,1663446470.0,"There was a property I liked. The listing was for 500k over market price. Because I was not familiar with the area and didn't ask my realtor to do a comp analysis I never bothered to find out the real price of the property. The listing agent relisted it for 500k lower at the end of August and I just found out that it sold in 4 days of relisting. 

I would have been happy to make an offer had I known this was a price they were willing to accept when I had first seen the property. But because they listed it 500k over the price I was willing to pay, I didn't even bother making an offer or checking for comps. 

Are listing agents really hoping that someone would come along and without doing a market comp analysis be like ""Hey I like this house. The listing agent is asking for 3M dollars. I might as well low ball at 2.9M and hope it sticks"".....While the market price for that area is 2.5M range.

In a slow market like today, why are agents not pricing in properties at market value? Nobody is acting emotionally and overbidding.

Again the theme is the same.  During the pandemic, detached homes in the GTA increased by 65%, whereas condos in the GTA increased by 25%.  This common occurrence happens in other periods of parabolic price growth that detached homes increased more than condos.  As with other corrections, detached homes will lead the price decrease while condos hold or lose a little value.

At the peak in Feb 2022, the price multiple of detached over condos was 2.3 and the price difference between detached and condos was about $1M.  Today with September's data, the price multiple is 1.87 and the price difference is $638K, both are record lows in 2022.  For those looking to upgrade their condos to detached homes, it seems prudent to wait until the price multiple of detached to condo is below 1.8, or until the nominal price difference is less than 500k.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/xx71bh/updated_with_september_data_as_expected_the_price/,"Updated with September data.

It‚Äôs insane. If you do 20 percent down payment, then you end up having a loss of 300 to 1000 dollars per month if you rent it out.

I had my opinions but he presented a logic that i thought should share here.   As per him it‚Äôs all mind games as this inflation is supply based.  Govt can only do so much (he has neutral thoughts about the rate hike).  His over all mortgage increased by $2030 annually (so far) and by his logic for the properties double the price tag can increase max by $6K annually(not able to understand the calculations but he seems confident). So if someone is able to afford a house with price tag of 900k/1M then 6K increase in overall spend is very well acceptable! In case they are not able to accept it then they should work on understanding their personal finances first. 
His point being, it‚Äôs ok if govt has increased the rates but this dramatic sentiment shift defies logic.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move.
The¬†new statement¬†hinted at that policy change, by saying the Fed ‚Äúwill take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.‚Äù

Economists are hoping this is the much-talked about ‚Äústep-down‚Äù in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

This week‚Äôs statement also expanded on previous language simply declaring that ‚Äúongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.‚Äú

The new language read: ‚ÄúThe Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.‚Äú",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/ykcsdb/fed_approves_075point_hike_to_take_rates_to/,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,News,25,22,0.76

At the time it seemed like things would just keep going up and I‚Äôd be priced out. My coworkers kept hassling me to buy into the market before it was too late so I did. I bought a precon because at the time I was lead to believe that it was my best option as it would appreciate before it was built and be brand new when I move in. The only RE agent I had was the builders obviously trying to pressure me into buying and my coworker who also pressured me into buying a property (specifically precon) ASAP. I don‚Äôt come from a financially literate family so I had no advice to fall on. 


Fast forward to now and I feel pretty swindled. I have nothing but myself to blame for not being more careful and I‚Äôve accepted the way things are. But I know I‚Äôm screwed, just don‚Äôt know how screwed. I‚Äôve considered I have two options. Since it‚Äôs 2026 move in date is so far away there‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôll be ok but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good one. Rates might be lower meaning I could afford a mortgage and property values may rise again meaning my appraisal won‚Äôt be negative by 100 000s of dollars and I could be ok and make it work.

My question is if I‚Äôm going to be underwater day 1 and not qualify for a mortgage should I just default on my deposits now? Next year I have to put another 50k down that I could save for myself and just lose my 100k already down. I don‚Äôt want to lose my 100k but I‚Äôll lose a heck of a lot more if I don‚Äôt quit while I‚Äôm ahead.

As demand cools so will inflation. Central banks will slow the pace and the size of interest rate increases. Housing prices will continue to deteriorate as interest rate increases, making housing unaffordable (ironic, isn't it?).

Inflation is contained to 2%. Due to weakening demand, higher unemployment rate, and inflation dipping below 2%, central banks begin to cut interest rates by 0.25%. The difference between this layoff and the 2020 layoff is that this time high salary workers (managers, high paying tech and finance workers) are affected. Stock market rallied to all time high due to interest rate cut (last rally before the big 40-60% drop). Despite interest rate falling, housing prices are still falling due to weakening outlook and people's worry about their ability to pay their mortgage given mass layoffs.

Central banks continue to cut interest rates at increasing size. Mass layoffs everywhere. High income earners are also laid off and are looking for work. Even with increasing interest rate cuts, housing prices are still falling due to layoffs and the banks tightening lending standards. 

Many (not all) redditors wishing for housing to crash will not buy due to 1) no job or 2) have job but fearing about job security. Out of fear, everyone is staying put, trying to survive a recession. Canadians reduced their debt to disposable income to a respectable ratio. Housing prices are finally bottoming out with prices going sideways.

As fear got almost too out of hand, some savvy investors with deep pockets will scoop up cheap houses. Housing will then stabilize as jobs are beginning to come back. 

Then the upward housing price cycle begins again.

Enter ‚ÄúCanadian home prices‚Äù into a Google search and you‚Äôll find endless headlines about real estate imploding.

That, and 13-year highs in [mortgage rates](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-mortgages-canada-fixed-variable-explainer/), have driven countless homebuyers to the sidelines. And many are now licking their chops, hoping to buy closer to the bottom.

To do that takes market timing. Most experts discourage timing for good reason. Gauging price direction can be a crapshoot.

Take the most widely used metric of prices in Canada, for example, the Canadian Real Estate Association‚Äôs average home price. The country‚Äôs average price has skidded 18.4 per cent from February‚Äôs peak, and likely 20 per cent-plus once July numbers come out midmonth.

But averages are misleading. More on that in a minute.

### Buying some time

If you‚Äôre a prospective [home buyer](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/), you probably want to know when it‚Äôs safe to go back in the water.

I‚Äôll give you some clues and a caveat. The caveat is, I‚Äôm not a fortune teller and don‚Äôt pretend to be a home price timer.

The clues that follow are legit, however, and their turning points will coincide with a bottom in most cases.

### Prices in your region

As mentioned above, average home prices can‚Äôt be relied on, particularly at the national level.

If you see the average price plummet, you have to dig deeper. Are similar types of homes (four-bedroom two-storeys, for example) selling for less? Or are people simply buying more apartment condos, which drags down the average price?

The latter is a major factor right now as steep mortgage rates slash buying power. Economists call it the ‚Äúcomposition effect.‚Äù

Average prices are also deceptively high because they‚Äôre constantly skewed by high-end sales. A bunch of $3-million-plus home sales can prop up average prices. But when people stop buying $3-million-plus homes, average prices can dive. Again, with [mortgages harder to qualify for](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-interest-rates-variable-mortgage-explained/), we‚Äôre seeing this trend now.

Median prices are a far better gauge of true price action but they still suffer from compositional effects, albeit much less than average prices. Problem is, it‚Äôs impossible to find median price data nationwide.

CREA doesn‚Äôt publish the data owing to restrictions from certain real estate boards. Hopefully this changes some day.

In the meantime, if you‚Äôre in Ontario or British Columbia, use a site like HouseSigma for median prices. It even projects median prices well before official data are released.

Since median data are unavailable in most regions, people have to rely on home price indexes (HPIs), which you can get from CREA, Teranet and RPS Real Property Solutions. HPIs compare similar types of homes, which makes price comparisons far more accurate.

[CREA‚Äôs version](https://www.crea.ca/housing-market-stats/mls-home-price-index/hpi-tool/) is solid because it‚Äôs based on sales in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), even if those sales haven‚Äôt closed yet. Hence, it‚Äôs as timely an HPI as you can get.

Tip: Check your [local real estate board‚Äôs](https://myrealpage.com/real-estate-boards/) HPI because most publish local data one to two weeks before CREA.

HPIs such as CREA‚Äôs let you get granular, showing prices of the home type and location you‚Äôre shopping for ‚Äì condos in Regina, for example.

For signs of a price bottom, you want the HPI in your region to at least start going sideways, potentially auguring a reversal upward.

### Home sales

Home sales lead prices and sales have been plunging thanks to soaring rates and buyer uncertainty. In many cases, sellers are [pulling listings](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-more-homeowners-cancelling-listings-turning-homes-into-rentals-as/) because they‚Äôre not getting anywhere near their asking price.

What you want to see is home sales at least starting to flatten out. Check your local real estate board as it publishes this data monthly.

### Inventories

When homes don‚Äôt sell, inventories pile up. As the number of homes for sale builds, people get more desperate and cut their prices. Some pull their home off the market altogether.

Fortunately in most regions, CREA suggests that people aren‚Äôt panic listing. But let‚Äôs see what happens in the fourth quarter or early next year.

Ideally you want to see inventory growth slow meaningfully, or pull back. Again, you can get this data from real estate boards and CREA.

### Unemployment

Most people don‚Äôt have to sell, so long as they have a job and can make their payments. Housing capitulation generally requires a surge in job losses and currently, Canada has a record low [unemployment rate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-canadas-unemployment-rate-fell-to-record-low-in-june-despite-losing/) of 4.9 per cent.

Thing is, our strong job market won‚Äôt last forever. If bond market predictions are right, we‚Äôre less than 18 months away from [recession](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/recession/). By the traditional two quarters of negative GDP measure, the United States is already in one.

To monitor unemployment, check [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410028701) monthly. It‚Äôll take at least a half-percentage-point jump in unemployment to start driving job-related forced sales and much more than a half-point for a true crash.

Just remember, it can take months for rising unemployment to translate to home selling.

### A turn in rates

If you‚Äôre a sideline buyer waiting for your big chance, you‚Äôll want to see:

1. A signal from the Bank of Canada that it‚Äôs done hiking rates ‚Äì which could happen by next year if our uninvited guest, inflation, decelerates meaningfully.
2. A continued drop in Canada‚Äôs five-year bond yield
3. The bond market pricing in rate cuts in the next 12 to 18 months

By the time these three things happen, much of the selling driven by rising rates will have ended.

**Final point:** I speak with lots of liquid real estate investors and most are just waiting to snap up bargains, especially given soaring rents and immigration-fed population growth.

Every serious buyer who is on the sidelines right now is watching these very same clues. If you‚Äôre a prospective buyer, you should, too.

And if you misread these indicators and mistime your purchase, it‚Äôs okay so long as you have a long-term time horizon. It may take two, five or 10 years, but in the long-run, real estate values always grow.

### Rates this week

Despite five-year bond yields tumbling 80 basis points from the June peak, banks are still holding out on lowering their uninsured five-year fixed rates.

Bankers I talk to attribute this to perceived credit risk in the funding markets, illiquidity and volatility (which affect funding and hedging costs) and static competition (banks don‚Äôt have to move if other banks aren‚Äôt moving).

Meanwhile, the country‚Äôs lowest insured five-year fixed rates are down 40 basis points from their 4.84 per cent peak in July.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoRealEstate/comments/wjg6gj/where_is_the_bottom_for_gta_real_estate/,Where is the Bottom for GTA real estate?,News,25,78,0.82
w0w777,TorontoRealEstate,1658023000.0,"Just as a friendly reminder of how credible our expert leaders are.

The BoC claimed in 2020 that it wouldn't raise rates till at least 2023. At that point, the overnight rates were 0.25.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bank-of-canada-rate-decision-1.5779813

Remember transitory? By early November 2021 inflation began to rear it's head. The bank maintained that this would be temporary and likely resolve itself by year end. 

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-canada-governor-reiterates-view-124900614.html

Oh, and most recently Tiff Macklem forecasted that Canada will likely have a soft landing and avoid a recession.

https://www.devondispatch.ca/news/economy/tiff-macklem-soft-landing-business-confidence

Of course the above example hasnt played out yet, but you can probably see where I'm going with this. Canada will not only be in a recession, but it will be an inflationary recession (stagflation) that will likely persist for several quarters.

We are only in the beginning stages of our rate cycle. Until wages come down or unemployment goes up, rates will continue to go up. What's wild to me is that the only medicine for our self induced inflationary crisis is a recession, and the BoC knows it. In fact, its policy is currently working towards creating a recession. So why doesn't the BoC governor own up to this fact and honestly address Canadians?

Here's a nice piece of advice that didn't age so well:

""If you‚Äôve got a mortgage of if you‚Äôre considering making a major purchase, or you‚Äôre a business and you‚Äôre considering making an investment, you can be confident rates will be low for a long time""

utd1qx,TorontoRealEstate,1652994307.0,"So just wanted to let all of you know of a recent experience (I am a realtor). 

My clients are in the market for a Condo Apartment in Mississauga, they have a maximum budget of 650k factoring in likely mortgage rate increases. 

I have advised them to be extremely cautious as units listed in the 650k range were worth 500k range less then 18 months ago. 

We found a unit that my clients liked, listed at 599 with an offer date a week ago. We elected to wait until the offer date and contact the agent following the offer date, as we expected very limited competition (I have a habit of monitoring the agent booking system and noting blocks of time where the unit is not available to show, this is indicative of a showing) during the few days leading up to the offer date, I estimated 2-3 showings. As I predicted no offers or very limited on offer date.  

The comparables in the building suggest an ATH of 725k in February of this year (the peak of the market) 

We initially offered 625k with no other offers and pointing to the downtrend in the market. The seller did not accept. My gut feeling is that the agent was advising his client not too. That said, we made a second attempt, increasing our offer (verbally) to 650k, this was Friday of last week. The agent said he would speak to his client but thought it was too low. I very much doubt he spoke to his clients, but I took him on his word. I told him we would touch base after the weekend (assuming the weekend would be slow showingwise just like it has been since the unit was Initially listed) so finally today I reached out to the agent to see if anything had changed and if they would finally consider our offer. The agent advised that they were terminating the listing and relisting at 750k. If you can‚Äôt attract buyers at 599 what makes you think you will
Be successful at 750k? 

The reason I point this example out is that I firmly believe this agent is getting in the way of the deal. The 650k offer is a good offer for this particular unit in a down market, (my client insisted on the price, even though I advised them not to go anywhere close to that high) the issue being the agent and the seller are stuck in fantasy land with February pricing in the back of their minds. That‚Äôs not the reality on the street. This downward trend has only started and once agents and sellers finally clue in that the market has changed for the good will we start to see real retractions in price. I find that inexperienced agents who do not have a good pulse on the beat of the market are slow to react and clue into what is actually going on.

There‚Äôs no doubt, 2022 was a challenging year for many Canadians faced with consecutive interest rate hikes by the Bank of Canada, eye-popping inflation numbers and a slowing real estate market. While rates remain high, we predict the latter half of 2023 should bring (eventual) relief. That means good news for home buyers, borrowers and real estate investors.

Interest rates haven't been this high since 2008, but some are predicting this could be the last increase for a while as inflation has begun to slow.

First house we bid on we were 2k higher than the winning bid, we just had a financing condition whereas they had no conditions. Tough search ensued, until we came across a 4 bedroom on a nice sized patch of land, and it was already 10 days past the conveyance date. We quickly set up a viewing and decided afterwards to put in an offer right away.

Our initial offer was a conservative one seeing as the house hadn‚Äôt been sold after a week and a half. We figured we could raise it if they countered.

* **Affordability is overstretched in BC and Ontario:** And conditions are now more challenging than usual in other parts of Canada too.
* **Price correction should soon bring relief to buyers:** The low point for affordability is likely close at hand.

vforgr,RealEstateCanada,1655619167.0,"As a mortgage agent, I get this question almost on a daily basis and rightfully so. We‚Äôre overexposed to real estate and interest rate news and content, and people who were once proud of their low variable rate feel the need to know what to do when the economic landscape seems so uncertain. 

This is the response I shared with someone earlier today and I believe it put things in perspective for them, so I thought it may help others. Please keep in mind that mortgage advice may only be given when we have a full understanding of a borrower‚Äôs financial situation and goals, so take this with a grain of salt as it may or may not be for you. 

‚ÄúDo NOT lock in your variable rate. You‚Äôre not just locking your variable rate; instead you‚Äôre switching over to a fixed rate. Based on the time left on your term, you‚Äôd be switching to a comparable term or longer, locking yourself in to pay a higher interest for a longer period of time. 

Consider your variable spread ‚Äî if you got it over the last 12-18 months, it‚Äôs one of the largest ones we‚Äôve seen. Prime minus 1% or more is something we don‚Äôt see anymore, unless you‚Äôre getting an insured mortgage, and this spread provides you with a very healthy buffer even when interest rates are on the rise. Also, the more BoC increases their rate, the lower the discount offered by lenders. 

Your variable rate is a true variable, meaning that your payments stay the same unless you hit a trigger rate ‚Äî the point where your payment no longer covers the interest. With Prime on the rise, it‚Äôs likely that you will reach that point sooner than later, and your amortization is increasing in the meantime. Don‚Äôt worry, it doesn‚Äôt mean that now it‚Äôs going to take you 40-45 years to pay your mortgage. At renewal, your payments will increase and reflect the necessary change to keep your amortization on track.

You got your rate when variable rates were at the lowest, and you got X# of months of upfront savings. What you‚Äôre experiencing right now is the price of variable, which is meant to fluctuate. Think of it as if your rate was never meant to be or stay that low. 

So far, everything I‚Äôve said sounds good but it may not help how you‚Äôre feeling, so I‚Äôd suggest you go back to the numbers. Numbers don‚Äôt lie. When banks give you the option to switch to a fixed rate, ‚Äúpenalty-free‚Äù or for peace of mind, they don‚Äôt do it out of the kindness of their heart.

Switching to a fixed rate means saying goodbye to ANY potential savings down the road for the next 4-5 years. With a fixed rate, you always pay a lot more interest more at the beginning of your term, and you will be paying the same interest for the entirety of your term. You can‚Äôt switch back once interest rates decrease. You also say goodbye to your friendlier break penalty, because breaking a fixed rate mortgage is always way more expensive.

My advice in this case is to change your payment altogether. Review your pre-payment provision. How much are you able to increase your payment by ‚Äî 10-20%? What would your payments be if you switched to a fixed rate? If you‚Äôre already willing to pay more every month (if you switched), you can increase your current payments without triggering a penalty. That way you keep your variable spread and hedge against the interest rate hikes. 

Increase your payments within your pre-payment allowance and don‚Äôt look back.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/vforgr/you_hold_a_variable_rate_and_now_youre_wondering/,You hold a variable rate and now you‚Äôre wondering if you should lock in‚Ä¶,,19,12,0.81

whr4x9,RealEstateCanada,1659800264.0,"With interest raising and a correction in place, I‚Äôm curious if there are consequences for having a mortgage greater than the value of your house, specifically investment properties.

As we all know people have successfully had perfect BRRR in past two years, able to refinance all upfront costs (downpayments, renos, land transfer tax, lawyer fees etc).

BUT now that some areas have corrected by 250k on a 750k investment,   Mortgages are now more than the value of the home although probably still cashflow positive due to locked in low interest rates.

Is there any consequence where the ratio  has to be rebalanced? 

For example. 750k house, 600k mortgage after refinance.

Now worth 500k, max 80% mortgage, so new max is 400k.

So mortgage owner must pay an additional 200k down on the mortgage to reduce risk?

I understand the banks want more total debt in mortgages to get the interest but isn‚Äôt this risky?

If we see these houses back to 350-400k and rents decrease these people will default and wont be able to sell to pay their mortgage debt.

They are a family of four, relatively new to Canada. They have been renting a detached-house in Mississauga since 2016. Over the last 6-years the landlord has reasonably raised the rent from year to year, starting from the original amount of $1,600 to a currently monthly rent fee of $1,800. This signals that he understood and may have been mores aware of legal prescriptions for rent increases - ish.

Last night, the landlord called to advise that he will be terminating the family's lease for at the end of the lease period. The landlord has never made mention of intending to move into the property, but rather advised that he would be listing the lease property for $2,800 monthly, a substantial jump. The landlord advised hat they were welcome to 'reapply' at the new amount. He also advised that the phone call would constitute a 'document 60-day' notice. He's definitely taking advantage of the family's limited understanding of the RTA.

My understanding is that rent increases are capped to a certain percentage, and if the landlord is not intending to move into the property, or their extended-family, that this eviction would be unlawful. He has never made mention of making renovations either, and didn't reference this fact in the phone call either. Rather he advised that he intends to maintain the rental operation.

I see people on here saying Canadian real estate is way overvalued. Are these people just referring to the big markets like Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, etc.?

I live in Nova Scotia (outside of Halifax), and I‚Äôve been throwing around the idea of building/buying a new primary residence and renting out the house I currently live in. 

I would estimate 80% of houses where I live are priced/being sold for less than 400k. 

I priced out a prefab home from a local supplier, and here‚Äôs the numbers I received:

Property: 20-100k
Well/septic: 20k
Driveway: 10k
Prefab home on frost wall: 300k+HST=345k
TOTAL: 395-475k

Add approx 20k for a stick built home‚Ä¶


After looking at the numbers, it looks to me that you can‚Äôt build more housing units for the same price you can buy pre-existing units. 

The way I process that in my brain is that the market where I live is actually undervalued, and prices can‚Äôt collapse as many people are predicting because they aren‚Äôt over inflated here like elsewhere in the country.

vwjk24,RealEstateCanada,1657549178.0,"so i have offer accepted on a 4 plex in montreal : 2\* 3.5, 5.5 and a 4.5 in the basement

cap rate 5.25%

price: 690k (16x rents while market is listed 21x rents usually), was a succession sale so could of gone for 800k+ so pretty happy i got it for this price. 

revenue: 1355 (2 top floor units) i see getting 800+ each unit over next few years, possible 1200 to 1500 for main and 800 to 1000 for basement so 40k to 46k+ as i can get 2nd floor to market.

each unit has their own hot water and electric panel, hydro covered by tenants. 

the inside is ready to rent, needs a paint job but i might spend 15k to cover the tile floors with vinyl plank as the color schemes are old looking, repaint, and the bathroom tile is ugly will just rip off walls and put drywall, also need a new roof around 20k.

current expenses: 3.3k taxes,1.2k insurance, 10% for pm fees.

so currently at 40k its about a -100 cashflows' to 200 a month cashflow's but i see this becoming a better deal over next few years. 

Overall i wanted to find a 12x revenue deal cash flowing 300+ a month but, there's nothing like this unless i buy far from montreal and it will be much harder to rent. 

just ratio wise this is the best i can find in my city, its a nice opportunity to refi this in a few years and get my down payment back. 

location is a C to B area, very easy to rent as its in montreal, near buses/metro, just its ville ray/st-michele so not best but still desirable. 

i was limited at 700k so for my approval getting a 4plex in montreal is pretty great with current limited inventory, especially when you find that most cash flowing deals need a lot of reno and this one is clean and ready to rent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/vwjk24/deal_check_on_4_plex/,deal check on 4 plex?,,12,19,0.83

They have had one offer fall through already and are pretty sure their second offer is about to fall through today. 

The first offer was at asking price, and after an inspection the buyers were asking for $25,000 off. Their complaints were mostly small things. The biggest item was the roof. It needs new shingles in the next few years. My parents had a quote earlier this year to redo the shingles for between $7500 and $9000. So the countered at $10,000 off and the deal fell though. 

They had another offer within a few days. This time they accepted an offer $15,000 below asking with the condition that they will not entertain a discount for the roof at that price. 

Today the new buyers said that the inspection found $17500 in things that ‚Äúneeded to be done‚Äù including a new air conditioner and furnace. But they were willing to take a discount of only $7500.  My parents said no. The air conditioner and furnace have had no issues. The list also included nitpicky things like a small chip near the front steps outside on the stucco and a small crack in the paint near a door frame.  My parents suspect this is the buyers attempt to get around the ‚Äúno roof discount‚Äù agreement.

so i bought a new house, i called my typical contractor which had done some repairs for me in the past. 

i created a list of everything i wanted done, and told him i needed it done by the 1st september as i was moving in after. 

he agreed to my list and said he could do it all for 20k, which was a fair price. 7k bathroom, 5k for the basement room, 3k for the front (repaint and caulking), 5k for the paint and electrical. 

we agree then the complaining begins. 

oh im over budget i need 10k more for the room downstairs though he agreed to it, as he says that when he oppend the walls their was no studs so what, studs dont cost 10k. stupidly i agree 30k for the whole job. pretty much a lot of mismanaging, ex calling in a electrician and plumbers then realizing theirs more works so having to call them again, passing the cost onto me instead of getting them to do all the work while they were there. 

then i start seeing the work he's doing and hes a damn amature, didn't demo till the studs put new drywall for the bathroom instead just ripped off existing tile and put a fuck ton of plaster to make the new tile straight.

i go see the house when hes supposed to be there noone is there, i remind him of the deadline now oh we cant do the room in time either, so i just say fine lets no longer do the room so we are now agreed at 21k, for half the work. 

today well the inside is ""done"", and all the remains is the front work and hes calling me complaining about money again and wants even more, which i stupidly agree too as i just want the damn work done. 

so hopefully this week she should be done the outside work.

so i hire somone else to do the room downstairs and he calls complaining about stealing work from him ect. while he simply didnt want to do it anymore, asking for even more money to finish the work.

Wahi's key insights from November 2022 include:

* 88% of GTA neighbourhoods are in underbidding territory in Nov 2022, a slight increase from 85% in Oct 2022. In contrast to Nov 2021 where only 15% of the neighbourhoods were in underbidding territory.
* Median amount of underbidding is flat on the previous month (-$20,000), but a drastic change from last Nov where overbidding was $77,275.
* There are still nearly 12% of the neighbourhoods at asking or above in Markham, East York, Richmond Hill and Oakville, with price points between $1.2M and $1.65M.
* A wider swing from median overbidding to median underbidding year over year while looking at non-condo property types (detached, semi, and townhouse): 81% of neighbourhoods are in underbidding territory Nov 2022, with a median underbidding amount of $26,450. Whereas Nov 2021, the majority of the neighbourhoods were going over asking by $133,000. Roughly $159,450 difference.

z6asvu,RealEstateCanada,1669578959.0,"We put a bid on a house over a month ago, and after some back-and-forth, the sellers went silent and we found out the next day that they sold to someone else for 1% more than our bid. This is after being told that they were no other buyers in play. Our agent was very frustrated that we weren't given the opportunity to compete, mentioning that this was not how realtors in our area do business. The other agent simply said it was the ""sellers' choice"".

For the record, this is a very high price point home with few comparables that had been sitting on the market for 5-6 months, and had finally reduced its price (but was still priced too high). However, due to lack of inventory and the recent price reduction, we were prompted to try given the desirability of the home. We made a very competitive offer vs comps. It would have been the highest sale in the history of the neighbourhood by about $150K, which was 17% lower than their initial asking. It's not unusual at this price point to sell for huge discounts, since pricing is not always obvious which I believe is the crux of the issue.

We had been told that the seller had just moved to another home in the neighbourhood, the highest comp before our offer, and we were very much encouraged to put in an offer. Our agents was even called and told that they would consider any offer. From the sounds of it, there had been no other offers, even when it was first listing in the spring of 2022. Clearly the house was overpriced. There was some back-and-forth, we went up slightly but told them that we felt our price was fair and we weren't going to budge anymore, after which they went cold.

I just looked up the land registry yesterday, and it turns out that the seller sold to a company registered to her sister. So it seems that they never intended to sell to anyone but the sister, and just used our offer to settle a pricing dispute among themselves. These people have all of the money in the world (very wealthy family), and own other high-end real estate. They should have been able to figure this out without stringing other people along. Incredibly selfish and thoughtless at the very least. My agent informed me that I have grounds for making a complaint with the real estate board.

A few years ago we had an agent deliberately sabotage a deal, AFTER severing ties with us (so they were no longer our agent). I had all of the evidence to file a complaint but we were moving with two young kids, and got a better house with a new agent, so we just let it go.

Quebec landlord over here. I am an owner of triplex in the Montreal island. I bought the building in April 2022, I inherited 2 tenets. One above and one below (me and my wife are occupying the main level). About a month in, my downstairs tenet (Woman with a boyfriend and child from a previous marriage) complained of Bed Bugs in their bed, upon verification, I immediately called for an exterminator and paid for it without question. I simply couldnt let a young family sleep and dwell in this situation.  


Fast-forward two months, bed bugs in their bed came back and we had the exterminator come again and fumigate the unit. Since then, the tenets changed their bed.  


This week, the tenet complained that the bed bugs are in her couch but not the beds. The exterminator came and verified that the bugs are not in any of the other units and it is just in hers, therefore it is highly likely it came from someone who visit, took public transportation or somewhere that it is infested with the bugs.  


The exterminator hated to recommended to throw away their couch. Since this costs $$$, I may offer to give the tenet some money to replace her couch in order to help her out a bit since couches are stupid expensive now.  


But out of curiosity, am i liable to pay for an entire couch as a landlord in Quebec?

I‚Äôm in New Brunswick where house prices are still low compared to some provinces, but so are our wages - despite that our taxes are the highest in the country.

Anyway. 

We have a small 3 bedroom 1 bath home (our current) to sell and expect to make 50k or so on it once we pay off our existing mortgage. It‚Äôs kind of hard to say.

wxm7md,RealEstateCanada,1661453450.0,"Hi, I'm in a bit of a dispute with the seller of our house over some furniture, and hoping to get any informed opinions.

We bought and moved into a house in April (in BC). The house has a rental suite with an existing tenant when we purchased, so we became the new landlords. The tenancy agreement includes certain pieces of furniture. However, there is no explicit mention of this furniture in the Purchase/Sale contract.

The seller is now coming to us claiming that the furniture is their personal belongings and since it wasn't included in the sale, it should be returned to them. They say they had an agreement with the tenant to return the furniture when the lease expires at the end of August. However, the tenancy is continuing month-to-month after that.

We feel differently. We bought a house with a furnished, tenanted suite, and figured naturally the furniture would stay with the house and transfer to us, so it strikes us as weird and petty that they would claim it back now, months after the sale. Any reasonable person would just walk away. We weren't party to any agreement they had with the tenant to return the furniture; all we have is the tenancy agreement which includes it. Furthermore, it's no longer their tenant. Obviously if we return this furniture, we and our tenant are inconvenienced, and we're out the $$ to replace it. The replacement cost isn't going to break the bank but it's a pain in the ass. I feel badly for our tenant being in the middle of all this; we're trying to avoid unnecessary disruption in their lives.

We've consulted our realtor and our lawyer for the transaction, and everyone seems to agree it's a legal grey area, but we might have a claim. Honestly, I can \*kind of\* see the seller's point of view on this, but it comes across as a bit shady, and we have reason to believe this sort of shadiness is...not beneath them, given our dealings with them throughout this whole purchase.

* Just under one in five houses and condominium apartments was used as an investment in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia combined.
* Condominium apartments were used as an investment more often than houses (single-detached houses, semi-detached houses, row houses and mobile homes). Ontario topped the list with the highest rate of condominium apartments used as an investment, at 41.9%.

For context, we are essentially equal partners (splitting down payment, mortgage qualifications, property management, etc)  

1. We were always planning to go with a B-lender at first for the mortgage with the assumption that we would be switching to an A-lender as soon as possible, but I had a call with RBC yesterday where they told me JVs between 2 un-related parties are an automatic decline for them, and that it's probably the same rule for all A-lenders. One workaround offered is to just have 1 partner on title and mortgage, and the other person is a ""silent"" partner with an agreement drawn up to detail the equity/ownership split. Are there downsides to this arrangement? Is one partner more vulnerable than the other in this set up?
2. What unusual scenarios have you encountered in a JV partnership that can serve as a cautionary tale and how did you resolve it/how could you have avoided it?

We recently bought a house in Quebec for $1+ million, we haven't moved in yet although we already signed everything. We're even doing floor renovations. I have just been contacted by a previous colleague about a fantastic job opportunity back in BC, one that I will most probably never be able to get in Quebec. I would probably move back in a heartbeat had we not purchased this house. A friend told me we could simply flip the house because we could probably sell it for the same amount we purchased it for, if not more. She's only speculating though, not a real estate expert, so we don't know. Would it be wise to flip it now, or wait for a period of time?

Nearing retirement we know we're definitely going to move once more and I don't really want to gamble for our retirement house. So we're considering hiring a custom builder. Ideally we want to live somewhere mostly immune to the neighbor lottery, which basically means a property with roughly a 2+ acre buffer zone around us.

It's my understanding that the process for this is basically:
1. Buy the property first
2. Hire the builder and they take care of the rest, ie permits, water, electrical, etc.

Is that about the gist of it? My question is do a lot of builders help you through any of that process?

wf9kng,RealEstateCanada,1659540604.0,"My mother is 76 and her health is getting worse. I don't think she will be able to live independently much longer. I don't want her to go to a nursing home; I'd rather have her home with me.

I have a house built in 2021, a split level detached house.  It is already set up so the basement is a full living space (bedroom, living room, full bathroom) minus a kitchen.

My municipality recently authorized multigenerational houses in my neighbourhood. I am thinking of building a kitchenette in the basement and have my mother come live with me. The problem is that a year after her death, according to the zoning rules I would have to demolish the kitchenette. The idea is to make it impossible to rent out if a family member doesn't occupy the living space. Obviously I don't want to spend money to build something just to have to spend more in a few years to tear it down.

However, I spoke with the council and I could obtain a permanent derogation that would allow the house to stay as a multigenerational dwelling indefinitely without having to scrap the kitchenette, though of course renting the living space would still be forbidden. The derogation would be passed on in the event of a sale.

My question is, would this, in general, lower the resale value of my house? It'd be a bummer to spend a few tens of ks for renos that would dumpster my home's value down the line, as I am thinking of selling within the next 10 years or after my mother's death if this pans out. The house is half paid off and I may be looking to downsize as I find it too big for me.

u7l1c1,RealEstateCanada,1650418468.0,"Hello,

I'm a FTHB and I'm not fully knowledgeable of the extent of a realtor's ""fiduciary duties"", it seems like a vague term to me.

Anyway the reason why I'm asking because I recently got interested in a house that is on a golf course, which also has a river flowing through the golf course. The city had a history of flooding not even 10 years ago.

So I asked the realtor to find out if there's any form of arrangement/agreement between the golf course owner, and the property owners on the golf course (which includes the seller), in the event that golf balls escaped the boundaries. I also asked that they check the land levels between the house and the river, so that I could know if the house is at a reasonable height above the river in the event a flood happens.

They came back to me the next day, saying that they asked the seller and seller said no golf balls ever flew into their home (duh?). They also said the seller's agent was not able to get that land height vs river info.

I was not impressed and specifically asked for golf course arrangement, stating my reasoning, but the realtor just casually brushed it off saying they wish me ""good luck with that"", which I felt wasn't fair as it seems within reasonable range of ""fiduciary duty"" in my interest. The flood thing I wasn't as miffed on, as I think maybe we need land surveyor for that, but at the very least they should properly find out the golf ball damages arrangement, if any. But again I'm not sure, but what I'm sure about is I want to know all these things before I commit money with peace of mind. 

Any realtors or buyers feel free to chime in, as I don't know if I'm being unreasonable.

y90nhw,RealEstateCanada,1666278279.0,"Hi there, I am looking for some advice for a situation my partner and I are in. Looking to see what others would do if they were in our shoes. We both just turned 30 and currently renting in Vancouver, BC. The dream has always been to purchase a house here in the Lower Mainland. We have 300K for DP saved up for a house and 40K for emergency. My partner and I bring home ~$11900 a month after tax. We also have a small online side business that‚Äôs profits roughly $20K after tax a year. Our dream has always been to purchase a house but as interest continues to rise and everyone‚Äôs talking about a recession, it‚Äôs becoming a concern whether we should purchase a house or downgrade our dream to just a smaller townhouse. 

Our borrowing power is $1.1M so we could technically buy a house that is $1.4M with a suite and rent it out. I checked that a $1.1M mortgage with 5.3% interest rate is roughly $6800 a month including property tax and utilities. That number seems so high even with a $1000 rental suite. In the same area we are looking at, there are several 12-15 year old townhouses that are 3 bd / 3 bath going for $700K-$800K and ~$350 in strata fees which would lower the mortgage payments (with $550-600K mortgage, I calculated to roughly $4200 in mortgage payments including tax and utilities a month). But I feel like we are so close to getting an actual detached home but worried that if one of us falls ill or even get laid off next year from a recession then we‚Äôd be very tight to make our mortgage payments. Getting a house in Vancouver seems impossible at our age without help, we‚Äôve worked so hard to save up and now it seems like a bit of a bummer to be settling for a smaller townhouse. We were thinking if we do go small maybe down the road we could purchase an investment. Looking to start a family soon so we can‚Äôt keep renting and holding off since our apartment is very small.

I had heard of special assessment and thankfully never had any, until this unit. 

In 3 years of owning it, ive had a special assessment each year. First year was about 1000$ for the roof. Second year was 3000$ for balconies being redone and now they are requesting an additional 6000$ for said balconies. 

Is this something normal I had been lucky to avoid?

We can afford to buy something now but would ultimately be looking to upgrade into a more expensive home in a couple/few years time. I recognize we could just wait to see where prices land but we have been renting now for a couple of years and we feel that we would rather put our money into our own home (and mortgage) rather than rent and pay someone elses mortgage.

Our question: if we get our first mortgage now and want to buy a more expensive home in 2-3 years, will there be any issues in doing so?

The other question I had is in regards to what I think makes sense but am I missing something? For example, if we buy a house now for say $999,990 and let's say in 2 years time, it crashes down to $600,000. Let's just imagine that, whether it will happen or not isnt really the point. And with that, say the $1.5 million home I wanted to buy, it too would in theory have dropped too, correct? So that 40% drop would sort of be across the board and not really negatively affect us in our situation?

yvbw8o,RealEstateCanada,1668458288.0,"Hello,

I'm very new to real estate ownership and admittedly, I didn't do as much research as I should have when making my first home purchase. Most people in my life are either equally as ignorant as I am, or give questionable advice, so I'm not sure where to ask for help. 

I have a 330k 25-year mortgage on a 5-year variable rate which has increased from 1.70% to 5.25% in a rather short amount of time. Looking back, it would've been wise to get a fixed rate mortgage when I bought my home, but I didn't expect the variable rate to go up so quickly. 

A few months back, about 60% of my monthly payment went towards interest and 40% of it towards the principal balance, whereas now, the amount of interest that needs to be paid has exceeded my monthly payment. This is a major concern for me.

My monthly payment is currently $1400 and the new monthly interest amounts to $1440. At this moment, I could only really afford to increase my payments to about $1600, so about $160 would go towards the principal per month, which at that rate, I definitely wouldn't pay off the home in 25 years. I think the ideal payment would be about $2000 a month, which I'd look to do so when my budget permits. 

So my question is, if I'm unable to significantly increase my payments to match how the payment was distributed before, what happens at the end of the 5-year variable rate? Will I need to make a large lump sum payment towards the principal to ensure that I can pay off the mortgage in 25 years? 

Not sure if I'm making any sense, but any help or guidance would be appreciated! If I need to clarify anything let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/yvbw8o/variable_rate_mortgage_question/,Variable Rate Mortgage Question,,5,4,0.78
yv7s64,RealEstateCanada,1668449812.0,"We had 6 people (4 boys and 2 girls) move into a three-bedroom upstairs portion of a house. They told me they are friends + family, 2 of them are engaged to each other, and 2 of them are uncle-niece.


I signed a lease agreement with all 6 tenants' names listed, they paid me security deposit as a group, and also pay monthly rent as a group, meaning I receive one payment in total, and I have one liaison I speak to.


Few months in, one of the tenants runs into me while I am working outside the house, and says he's moving out in a couple of weeks and this is his verbal notice. This was my first interaction with this particular tenant (he was the only one who wasn't present when the group visited to view the rental property and paid their security deposit). He said he's had a falling out with his housemates and they won't return him his portion of security deposit so I should give it to him instead.
I explained to him that I can only return security deposit at the end of their tenancy as a group, so he should get his security deposit from his friends instead. Or, he can find a replacement tenant who will give him his security deposit and the replacement tenant would be entitled to his portion of the security deposit being returned when the entire group's tenancy ends. He did neither and would call me every week or so, asking for his security deposit, with us going back and forth between me saying he should get it from his group, and him saying he's entitled to it directly from me. Finally, I put my foot down and said he was in breach of his lease agreement by moving out early and not finishing out the term so he's not entitled to any security deposit, as I am entitled to keep it as my damage.

A couple of months later, another housemate said he wants to move. He gave me 1 month's notice over text and went through the same conversation of wanting his security deposit returned. I explained the same options to him:

1) Get it from your friends' group

2) Find a replacement tenant

3) Show up when the group's tenancy ends to claim his portion

He opted to find a replacement person and got the new person to pay him his portion. The leaving tenant never notified me about a replacement coming in. (I had explained to him that I would want to vet the replacement tenant and sign a separate agreement with him). A month into the replacement tenant staying with the original 4, the original 4 contacted me and said they're not jiving with the replacement and they want him out, as he's been harassing them. (Essentially, the original 4 had a difference of lifestyle with the replacement but opted to let him in as the replacement for the departing tenant to help reduce their monthly portions of the rent). I spoke to the replacement and said I don't even know who you are as I never met him and hadn't spoken to him at all prior to this interaction, and that since I don't have a formal agreement with him, he should leave.

I advised the original 4 to not let the replacement tenant in (he didn't have a separate set of keys) and to call the police if he keeps harassing them. They did exactly that - he showed up late, wanted to be let in, the original 4 called the cops, the cops escorted him away, he asked to be let in briefly to collect his stuff, the cops supervised his entry so he could, and he moved on. I never met him in person, only spoke to him over the phone 2-3 times, and never had a signed agreement with him.

Now, the second person who had moved out, who had brought the replacement in, is calling me and asking for his security deposit. I explained to him that he already collected his portion from the replacement tenant, so he replies, he's calling on his replacement's behalf, and I said, I can take this up directly with the replacement, and the second departed tenant doesn't need to be involved. The replacement tenant never contacted me.

Now, I get a text from the second departed tenant that it's been almost a month and half and I haven't returned his security deposit and if I don't do it by today, he will make a legal complaint against me.

He doesn't have any legal grounds to make a complaint and have it go in his favour. He breached the tenancy agreement by moving out early, brought in a replacement that wasn't vetted by me and got no paperwork done.

The security deposit portion is about $230. It's a small amount but it's about the principle of the matter. I don't think I am in the wrong at all. Where I dropped the ball was not clarifying upfront how to handle early departures, as I was under the impression that the entire group is close-knit and would move in and move out together.

Also, for both tenants leaving, I offered to have a sit down with the entire group so they could hash out their differences and the leaving tenant could make their case for collecting their security deposit from the group. But in either case, none of the group members wanted to do that, including the original 4.

I had also advised the original 4 to return the replacement tenant's security deposit since they are the ones who wanted the change of forcing him out. The replacement tenant was paying rent just fine but the original 4 are arguing that they never got paid the portion as the replacement paid his portion to the second departed tenant.

So far, I've just ignored the text. Should I engage the guy and lay down the law? Or let it run its course?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/yv7s64/tenant_threatening_to_make_a_legal_complaint/,Tenant threatening to make a legal complaint,,5,15,0.73

Most recently the place is fully vacant. Last renter abandon their lease and left the unit in bad shape. 

Currently I‚Äôm attempting to sell the place as it‚Äôs been to much stress but I‚Äôm not getting a buyer. I have the place listed for $145,000. On the market for 90 days. 

Also it‚Äôs been on the rental market for months and month without finding suitable renters. PM tells me people viewing it don‚Äôt have anything bad to say. Those that have applied have been rejected by PM as they don‚Äôt meet the standards.

Also the abandoned unit requires $8,000 of work to get it back in shape.  The other half of the duplex I spent $6,000 to get flooring and paint done. 

The property has been managed by a PM company the entire time but I have learned PM‚Äôs suck at basically everything. Already fired one company and the second company is not much better. 

Also now that it‚Äôs vacant I have been having issues with homeless people breaking in. 

So what‚Äôs best. Drop sale price super low so eventually someone buys it ? I have a mortgage of $100,000 and a small line of credit.

How much do you think it would cost to totally renovate a 1950's era bungalow of this size? I'm just curious how much the flippers are aiming to make given the cost of renos. It was bought in may and it's been on the market for a couple of months, so it was some fairly quick renos. I have a feeling the renos might have been done by some cheap labour.

Buy a property, renovate to force appreciation, rent it out, refinance to pull out equity and use said equity as the downpayment on another property to repeat the whole process.  But how are people able to qualify for so much debt?

I understand this in LCOL areas where houses are $200-300k but in places like the GTA or GVA where nothing is really under a mil, how is it possible?  If someone bought a place for even $800k with $200k down, they would need a $600k mortgage which would already require an income of greater than $100k and would come out to over $2500/month even at only 3%.  

Let's say they do some renos which pushes the value of the house up to $900k, they pull out the $100k and rent it out for $3000 a month.  They would barely be cash flowing- probably not at all once accounting for property taxes, maintenance, etc.  But let's even say that they could cash flow $1000 a month- that only adds $12k a year to their gross income and to buy another $800k property with $100k down they would need another $700k loan, which they would be unlikely to qualify for.

Here is the full story:

My realtor helped me draft an offer on one property yesterday. However, the seller did not accept our offer. I do not want to have her as my realtor anymore because

1. I am not happy with my realtor's performance (i.e. She did not show me the selling history of the building until I asked for it; She did not provide the statistics for the market even though I asked for it, so I need to do all the research myself)
2. I want to make another offer on the same property without her, so the seller can save some commission fee and might be willing to sell at a lower price

However, I signed the¬†""disclosure of reimbursement"" and ""disclosure of representation¬†in trading services"" with her while making the offer (here is the link to the form [https://www.bcfsa.ca/media/712/download](https://www.bcfsa.ca/media/712/download)  ; [https://www.bcfsa.ca/media/648/download](https://www.bcfsa.ca/media/648/download)) . I noticed that it says ""this is not a contract"" on the¬† ""disclosure of representation¬†in trading services"".¬† But I am not sure these two disclosures have other¬†legal grounds. So now my questions are

1. Is it legal if I buy other properties by myself, without having the help of my current realtor? Then the¬†seller¬†does not need to pay her commission¬†fee and I will have more negotiation power.
2. Will I be in trouble if I decided¬†to make another offer without my realtor for the same property?

I know these questions are in the grey zone, sorry if I made you uncomfortable. I thank her time but she did not provide any helpful suggestions... I will still buy her a $500 gift card for the 8 hours she spent with me.

It sounds like it's nothing like PurpleBricks now - they have actual realtors that come in spend time with you, take professional photos, and they have some senior negotiating team that helps you navigate offers (unlike purplebricks, where support was poor).

They also set a buyer's realtor commission - you can set it to like 2.5%, and that may draw  realtors to show the place?  I know there was a concern that relators won't show the place... why would they not if they get commission?

And it's risk free - it goes on MLS, if it doesn't sell, you don't pay.  If it saves, you pay $4k, and save like 10k on commission.  Although have to commit 4 months.

The tenant in question moved into one unit of our triplex a few months ago and during that time asked if he could use the basement to store a single bike he uses to commute to and from work. The lease that he had signed explicitly stated that there was no extra storage space outside of the space inside the rental unit he was leasing and I had also verbally informed him that there was no storage space. He also did not have any previous access to the basement.

However, thinking that it was not a big deal I agreed to allow him to store his bike in the basement underneath the property. Unfortunately the tenant took advantage of my generosity and I later found out they had started moving other things into the basement without my knowledge. Being concerned that he would continue to move more and more things and fill the basement completely I changed the locks and texted them informing them that they were no longer allowed to use the basement as storage and to set up a time meet to remove their bike and other belongings.

The tenant however ignored my text and instead sent a legal letter stating that because I had agreed to let them use the basement to store the bike, I was not legally allowed to change my mind and take back their ability to use the basement as storage. They also stated that if I did not give them new keys to the basement that they would file a T3 application with LTB alleging a reduction in services as well as a T2 application alleging harassment and substantial interference with his use and enjoyment of the unit.

I have spoken to various paralegals who have informed me that I am legally allowed to change my mind and ask for them to remove their bike and belongings because use of the basement as storage was not part of the original lease agreement and also because it was explicitly stated in the lease that there was no additional storage space available as an amenity.

If, for example, we were to use Lender A‚Äôs pre-approval to sign the contract with the builder to ensure that we can qualify for the new build and then further down the line we were offered a better rate by Lender B 3-4 months before possession, could we switch to Lender B? 

For reference, the build time for the home is 10-12 months, and in our instance, a big bank is offering to provide us with an approval, income check and appraisal right now and they do not have re-check everything at time of possession, even if our income or job situation changes. However, they are offering a higher rate. With a mortgage broker, they advise that we should get the rate hold 3-4 months before possession and assess at that point, which would be a much lower rate than what the big bank is currently offering. 

We‚Äôre nervous our income or job situation may change come time for possession so for some assurance, we‚Äôd like to get pre approved with the big bank, and if anything happens, we still have the mortgage approval from them. We‚Äôd ultimately like the lowest rate, which we can get from another mortgage broker at a later point.

Owner said they tried to sell property Q1 of this year, had an contingent agreement with a buyer at their ask of $475k. Buyer dropped out. Buyer then approached them this fall with a lower offer and shorter close date, which they rejected. No other efforts to sell the property so far. House was appraised this spring at $450k, which I suspect is what they actually want out of it. In this area, it is in the top 10% of houses. 

Seller is at retirement age and looking to move out of town. They want to close next summer. We are currently renting and can accommodate their schedule.  

Property was built new in 2011. They purchased it from the builder in 2012 for $410k. They did minimal yard improvement and replaced the hot water tank but otherwise no material changes/upgrades. House appears well maintained. Generally the market has been flat here (it boomed in 2014-15 from oil then dropped back and has never returned to those highs).  Relatively illiquid market, real estate here does not turn over frequently. Given the significant change in interest rates, I suspect there is downward pressure on prices. There aren't many good comparable as most of the houses in this area are older.  Lots in that area sell for $65k and don't require any fill to get to a serviceable level.

we have made 0 improvements on the property and overall the inside has not been redone since the 60's.

i used the calculator to find out that my taxes will be around 10k which is kinda insane for no actual improvements, its just a cash grab by the local gov at this point.

so my options are to pay 300$ for the evaluator to come by and hopefully reduce the municipal evaluation or just take the 2k increase. this building is residential and housing family so an increase in value doesn't help just makes taxes more expensive. 

last time a evaluator came by was a idiot that was hunting for reasons to increase the assessed value, to the point he added 40k for a inground pool that turned out to be a kiddy pool worth 20$.

xa3jg1,RealEstateCanada,1662749952.0,"EDIT: I plan to read more books/resources for real state investing, but this is just my initial perspective from someone who absolutley knows nothing.

Hey all,

I'm from Canada. I am fortunate enough where my parents saved up enough cash and they told me that If I were to save up my salary we can get a \~500k CAD condo in Toronto via cash soon or a big downpayment mortgage (> %50) . I see it as a forever home but it might be a investment vehicle too. Worst case in NYC is  84,796 CAD. I will back to Canada if that happens, no reason to stay in NYC.

# My Salary:

I make 90k take home here and the cash flow expense is \~20k  per year or \~1650 per month (maintenance and mortgage) + 1.5k property tax. If I lose my job, I can probs get another one for 50k takehome worst case in Canada. In NYC, I would be mak

# Moving to U.S and Housing prices:

However, there is a good chance I will be moving to U.S (NYC) for better pay in the next \~2 years due to my career, software eng. Interest rates in Canada are \~5% and expecting rate hikes. Prices for condo haven't dropped significantly after COVID yet.

I am hesitant about accepting this offer because I do not want to be burdened by mortgage in Canada . I think I can just rent it out for \~2k per month pre tax although I would be taxed 25% of rental income by Canada when in the states. **What are the things I should consider before deciding? Financialy/investing purposes, lifestyle considerations, etc?**

Another reason why I want to decline is because I can also tell my parents to save their money and dump it on stocks  now since they are cheap so they can retire more comfrotably in the future

# Calculations:

I do not see a huge incentive to purchase when calculating cash flow and cash on cash return, but I'm pretty sure I am missing the bigger picture like appericaiton or potentialy oppurtunities like refinance equity -> leverage another real estate:

Say if I were to buy with cash for 500k:

**Cash flow:** 2 \* 12k -  1.6k \* 12 - 1.5k = 3 300 \* 0.25(25% tax when I move to the states) = **$825 per year**

**Cash on cash return** :  825/ 500 000 =  **0.00165 %**

Say if I were to downpay with 250k:

**Cash on cash return** 825/ 500 000 =   **0.0033 %**",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/xa3jg1/my_parents_wants_to_buy_a_condo_for_me_but_i_plan/,"My parents wants to buy a condo for me, but I plan to move to the U.S soon. What do I do?",,4,10,0.83

Hey all,

I have the chance to save up and buy a cash for a home or I can get a long term mortgae rate soon. I am unsure which to pick yet.

Do people save up for a long term mortgage rate because say ETF returns at \~4% real rate and say interest rates are 2%, by taking a mortgage you can profit another 2% real return. 

However, with current interest rates right now , 5%, does it even make sense to buy with a mortgage? 

I've also heard that ou should still borrow because  ""If inflation is higher than the rate you have from the bank then the bank is losing money."". From my understanding though is that you are losing money on inflation an on the rising interest rates.?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/x6mudh/buying_a_home_cash_vs_mortgage_rate/,Buying a home - cash vs mortgage rate?,,4,5,0.75

I want to open up a HELOC on a Quadplex located near Montreal.

I‚Äôve personally only gotten a HELOC once with my condo several years ago and I remember that the banks third party evaluator under valued my condo compared to the market, was worth 460k but evaluator put 425@. Which makes me think that these guys hired by the bank are told to do this on purpose.

I‚Äôm about to hire an evaluator for $1250 and I wanted to see if anyone has had any experience hiring their own evaluator and providing the evaluation to the bank. I figure that if I hire my own evaluator, I can get the proper evaluation.

There‚Äôs some structural work that‚Äôs not too too major but it‚Äôs looking like it could be 60k to complete. I was wondering if anyone had experience with negotiating final price. My realtor is already saying it‚Äôll be tough. However, I feel like we have massive leverage. 
1. The initial offer fell through and I was second highest so I got accepted a week later. Only one other offer and that one was definitely lower than ours. Not even sure if they‚Äôd still be waiting around since offers were made over 3 weeks ago.

2. I have an approved mortgage. Not just a preapproval so the financing is set.
3. This is a bit of a unique property in terms of layout so the pool of buyers isn‚Äôt as big.
4. The interest rates have gone up more than expected recently which should in theory lower prices (though I know there‚Äôs a bit of a lag)
4. Only thing working against me is my preapproval expires in a month so if I pull out I‚Äôll basically have to go variable and would likely wait out the market to reflect the higher interest rates.

The way I see it, the sellers will get significantly less by going to the next guy or relisting since other buyers are going to have the same leverage as me. At this point I‚Äôm pretty sure housing will go down a bit and have no problem walking away from this place if the price doesn‚Äôt make sense. The house is a 1 million duplex located in Montreal near downtown (By Concordia area). Comps we‚Äôre at a similar price point when my offer was made but I‚Äôd have to check now to see if they‚Äôve gone down or not. If my realtor is not able to negotiate then I was thinking of dealing with the sellers agent directly to let them know my position and my willingness to pull out completely if there isn‚Äôt a good faith attempt to negotiate based on the unexpected repairs/structural issue. I‚Äôm an investor so for me theres no reason to overpay especially going into the upcoming recession. Any advice on how much is reasonable to negotiate would be much appreciated.

Update: Was able to negotiate 45k off the offer price (about half the cost of renovations) as the company doing the quote we‚Äôre biased and didn‚Äôt give a high enough quote due to relationship with the seller‚Äôs realtor. Also didn‚Äôt help that my realtor was fear mongering about the sellers potentially backing out. Ughhh stressful process but it‚Äôs finally done! Appreciate everyone‚Äôs advice on this!

I have a closing on a condo next week, and am wondering how the HST rebate for new homeowner works. From my understanding, I pay 24k and then get that back, but how does the process work?

My condo is a rental property and I have tenants who moved in last month. Now, when I pay the 24k, how soon can I claim it back and how long does it take to receive the rebate? Are there any specific rules for that in terms of a primary residence v rental? Are there any further tax implications on that amount if me and my wife are making over a certain amount/year?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/uj0m49/new_homeowner_hst_rebate/,New Homeowner HST Rebate,,4,5,1.0

Hi, 

As someone who is living in Vancouver, BC a place known to have a HCL paired with one of the lowest paygrade relative to other provinces such as AB and ON - I have always considered getting a second job.

I am looking to see if there is anyone who may be or has been in a similar circumstance as me where:

1. I have a full-time office job that is 100% remote - meaning I do have a great degree of flexibility in my day. I am currently working in the financial industry and have a CPA designation. 
2. May pay is decent, but not great. As someone looking to purchase their first property, my current income and savings situation would make this extremely tight and financially burden me and potentially my family greatly. 
3. I have all evenings and weekends completely open, I tend to do some hobbies and sports but I would love to use this time to earn another stream of income.
4. I have been a local living here for over 15 years and have a few decent connections - however I am still in my 20s and people around me are not necessarily in a position to purchase or sell a property yet. 

The above points has led me to search for potential jobs I can work on the side with good growth potential. 

**Why a Realtor?**

I am aware that people often say that the barriers to entry is low and that the realtor market (especially in Vancouver) is way over saturated. However, the fact that there is such a huge gap between your average realtor selling 3-5 places a year versus others selling 100+ makes me think that this market is not saturated, rather those who put the time and effort in will thrive as opposed to those doing the bare minimum.

I have spoken to some realtors, those who are starting out to those who are in the top 1% - the responses to my question varies. In general, I never got a clear response on whether this is doable or not and rather, once I see first-hand how much I can truly earn in this profession - it will change my life. 

My friends have always told me I am quick on my feet, have a way with my words and am very easy to get along with - the soft skills are there along with my years of experience working in customer service.  These are some of the qualities that they mention would be a tremendous asset in this field, the remaining would be the technical skills which could be learned. 

In the end, what really made me want to decide to pick a realtor was the experience I had when viewing a few open-houses. Almost all of the houses I went to look at, the selling side realtor simply sat down on a chair and scrolled on their phones - only responding to questions if I ask. This seemed to be the norm and I thought to myself, was this really all it took? Of course, most realtors tell me ""properties in Vancouver sell themselves"" but I did not think it was to this extent. The majority of research was done on my own and by my realtor - the sell side did put any effort in.

To conclude, I wanted to be a realtor as I thought to myself, how many others are also experiencing this? I believe I could provide a service that I would like to have received myself - where I could lessen the stress of making the biggest purchase of one's life by preparing my customers better and educating them. 

**Concerns**

As I am planning to buy a property within the next year, I need to have a stable full-time job to apply and receive a mortgage. I would also need it to continue paying rent, personal expenses and expenses related to being a realtor (licensing costs, desk fees, advertising(?)). 

I have already signed up and am submitting assignments to the Real Estate Trading Services License course and plan on writing in August 2022. 

My fear is that being someone that can only work part-time (for now) would hinder my ability to get a position at a brokerage such that they are willing to invest into my development and training. From my talks with realtors that are doing well the commonality is that they all had a great mentor and/or team where they could learn from. 

Another primary fear is that I do not have enough strong connections to be able to secure leads and convert them into deals - however this is something I was told by a successful realtor that could be worked on as they started fresh with 0 connections here and worked their way up to being a top realtor in a single year. 

My action plan is as follows:

1. Complete and get my RETS License
2. Do research and interview with different brokerages that I believe I can vibe well with, I have always cared about who I work with as opposed to where I work - people is everything. 
3. Spend Sept - Dec 2022 working part-time (20-25 hours) and make it a goal to close at least 2 deals. This would cover my expenses for being a realtor and also allow me to assess the market after the interest hikes. 
4. Continue to develop my skills and build experience throughout 2023 and ideally transition into real estate full-time. 

**Conclusion**

As stated above, I'm hoping to get any feedback on my situation and plan above - whether its getting flamed for being so idealistic or someone who experienced the same and succeeded / failed, I'd be happy to hear it all.

Regardless of which, I believe taking action is the most important step and as such - I will still put the effort into making this work for my 2022-2023 plan.

**TL:DR**

\- Looking to be a part-time realtor while having a full-time job

\- I want to be a realtor after realizing that I believe there is much more room for improvement based on personal experiences

\- Fear is not finding a good mentor/team that is willing to invest in me as I am only part-time and trouble getting leads

\- Anyone that is or was in a similar circumstance, please drop some of that wisdom in me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/uh6qtv/part_time_realtor_is_it_possible/,Part Time Realtor - Is it possible?,,3,6,0.59
ugqxop,RealEstateCanada,1651501809.0,"Hi everyone, 

I have a pre-construction condo and am selecting my first set of upgrades. It's a 1+Den 2bath and will be used as a rental. The master ensuite has a tub, the second bathroom has a frameless glass shower which I'm considering ""upgrading"" to a tub instead. I have no other info on the shower itself (e.g. tile selection/exact construction.)

It's a $450+HST upgrade so want to make sure it's worth it since my realtor pointed out that glass showers are actually more expensive than a tub (so basically paying to ""downgrade"")

Simply from the perspective of long term maintenance and durability, is having a tub better than a glass shower? By that, I mean will a shower require more frequent repair or replacement of grout, tiles, caulking, etc, increase likely hood of water damage vs a tub. I know rentability wise, tubs can be a selling point for some (families, etc), but I'm just looking at it from a longevity and maintenance cost standpoint.

ubatzy,RealEstateCanada,1650854368.0,"I bought a house in February for \~$650k (down payment \~$150k and mortgage \~$500k). The mortgage was closed and finalized in March with a Big 5 lender. Closing date with the notary is in early July. Since closing the mortgage, my financial situation has changed.

My gross income was $125k from one job at the time of closing the mortgage. I was initially told by people close to me that once the mortgage has closed, the bank will not re-verify your income or savings, so I went ahead and changed jobs after closing on the mortgage (stress issues and needed a new lifestyle, but that's another story).

The new job is in a different industry and I will be past the 3-month probation date by the time of signing in July. The income is $85k. However, I am likely to also stay on with my previous employer as a contractor (1-year renewable contract) for $70k ""guaranteed"" with a much lighter workload (so total income would be $155k), delivering work on an ad hoc basis outside of my regular work hours for the other job (going to sign contract this upcoming week with 90% certainty; both employers are fine with the situation). I know banks usually do not look favorably at contracting income, especially if <2 years, so let's assume they don't count this even if it's with the same employer.

Separately, I have received an inheritance and my savings have increased from \~$200k to \~$500k (edit: this will be net of tax).

So, as I see it, my financial situation has actually improved if anything BUT it has clearly changed materially and the lender would view the income as lower if they do not accept the contracting income.

The mortgage agreement I signed with the bank does not state I need to inform them of any such changes or that they will check my financial situation again before the notary signing.

So a few questions:

* Is the lender likely to check my income again right before closing date? I read many threads saying that it does happen (usually within 1-10 days before closing), but all people I have asked about this IRL told me it did not happen to them, so I'm a bit confused.
* If they do check, especially on short notice before the notary date, would they likely reject me or would my situation still be ok, especially if my savings are much higher now (I can make a higher down payment if needed too)?
* Overall, how should I handle the situation?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/ubatzy/help_needed_change_in_financial_situation_after/,Help needed: change in financial situation after closing mortgage but before notary signing date,,5,10,0.78

What sparked this thought is that our neighbour who built the same year as us (2017) just listed their freehold house in Ottawa for $1.1M and sold it within a week for $1.4M.  The home is a basic bungalow, slightly smaller than ours, very basic finishings, 2 acres of land, 4 bedrooms and 2 baths.

Our home is larger, with a lot more upgrades (kitchen, bathrooms, fixtures, fireplaces, premium lighting, smarthome equipped throughout, extensive landscaping, etc), 5 bedrooms, 3 full baths, gym, yoga room, workroom, two large storage rooms, extended garage. We are on 3 acres of forested land which keeps it completely private, a walk-out finished basement, 3 patios (two with dining areas and lounge seating), a hardscaped fire pit area, outdoor koi pond, large ironed fenced dog run with river rock and artificial turf, lots of groomed gardens and overall nicer curb appeal. There is about 1.5 acres untouched, so our view is pure of beautiful trees. The land behind will also never be developed as it's landlocked and protected. We are located in an estate neighbourhood just outside the suburbs, but close to the highway to get downtown (~30 minutes). After our home was completed, the city put a building freeze on estate neighborhoods to help densify the downtown and suburban zones. Since the pandemic, a lot of residents are now working from home and starting families. Our home is perfect for that and we have no kids, just dogs. Ottawa is seeing a large population boom with those leaving Toronto and Vancouver. Our neighbourhood is in extremely high demand and is located in the hottest real estate zone in the city according to statistics. 

As I mentioned, we're not really in the *need* to sell our house, but we have always wanted to live on the water, and think if we do sell we could afford a nice lakefront place or build on the Quebec side of Ottawa. 

With this established, could we just list our home for $2M and see if there are any bites? I think this could be a bit outrageous, but I think we can obtain this given other specs in the area that are selling. I think at this price, we would be willing to sell and be able to afford to move to a place we'd be happy with.  How does home pricing work? Can we just ask a realtor to sell for this price, or are there restrictions or regulations they need to abide by?

zezzqv,RealEstateCanada,1670416240.0,"I've seen tons of posts about GTA/Toronto Real estate and I hate to sound negative but it just seems so  difficult to achieve and is so depressing looking at the housing market if you're a FIRST TIME BUYER (haven't looked since February 2022). Before you come at me I know it's still possible but I'm just wondering if anyone has thought of investing overseas (somewhere much much cheaper) 

Even with good case scenarios I see some couples making 6 figures (100-120k) each. Which is $200-240k yearly - after tax that's $140,000 - $160,000 CAD which is very decent but still 'Struggling' to buy a home or just having to go really far from the City to just to \*BUY\* and gut/renovate etc. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has thought of using that same down payment money ($150-$200k) they're willing to buy with in Toronto for $1.2M CAD elsewhere ? Overseas, maybe like an Airbnb investment or just for future retirement. Toronto is an ethnic melting plot, no one really represents 'Canada' and even if they do they'll say  ""Yeah we're Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Ethiopian, Jamaican, Indian etc.."" despite them living here for a few generations. I've noticed that we (Torontonians) travel a lot overseas to where ever and every time someone comes back they just wanna get up and leave again because they can't be here too long. 

Investments in other parts of the world (Caribbean, Europe, Africa, Eastern Asia) seem so much more achievable, I know there's always a catch being a foreign investor and possibly losing your money to corruption or being taken advantage of but I'm sure people are still doing it. I've only seen rich elder people do this, never a young couple or Young professionals. I know the real estate landscape has changed around the world and it's not like the 1990's however I often hear the older crowd taking about ""Yeah I bought some land in the year \_\_\_\_ for $30,000 and now it's worth \_\_\_\_ I can build a home there if I like"" And I'm just here sitting thinking ""how do I penny pinch and invest into stocks to get $170,000 CAD in my TFSA and FHSA"" So that I can buy a 600Sq foot condo at Young and Eglinton for $800,000 with a maintenance of $400/month or a preconstruction in Ajax for what is now $1.1M? Just sounds so depressing...

I feel like with certain career paths and industries the 9-5ers will be able to Work from overseas and people won't care if you're not in the office for a few months in the winter. So maybe live somewhere hot during the winter months and come back in the summer as you just rent a place? Obviously that's easier said than done and comes with it's own difficulties but yea. 

I just feel like anyone who recently bought in the past few years are just paying such a high mortgage  and not able to do anything, they're essentially just 'Stuck' at home always doing stay at home related stuff. Yeah sure you're an owner but at what cost? Some even bought at such a price that they'll lose money monthly if they even try to rent it out and therefore can't re-locate. I'm aware that not everyone just wants to leave Canada but I'm wondering if anyone has given up on Canadian Real Estate and invested elsewhere or even thought of it as they continue to rent, if so - where and what was the process like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/zezzqv/invest_your_canadian_real_estate_money_savings/,Invest your Canadian Real Estate Money savings overseas?,,3,9,0.71
z74hxm,RealEstateCanada,1669660833.0,"The question comes down to is it cheaper to rent a place when we need to or better long term to just outright buy a cottage?

Every christmas my family and i rent a place for the holidays and its easily 400$+ a night. so starting to question if its better to just buy a country house, something waterfront to go fishing in the summer and escape in the winter.

overall our lives are very routine 2 young school age kids so cant leave during the week, maybe would go on weekends. maybe have airBnB or other short term rental set up when we are not using it. 

pro's:

don't have to search a place to go when we want to escape the city for a bit, we would just have the country house.

i love fishing i would go everyday, so having a place to stay like that means i can go there an surrounding lakes anytime

all your beach stuff, camping stuff stays there extra storage don't need to bring it all down each time

might actually do more activities as we feel we have to make the most of it, we just netflix and chill most of the time at home, kids might be closer to nature

cons:

we don't have a car so need to rent one each time we want to leave the city, could borrow from family

feeling obligated to go, my ex had a place and her dad would guilt trip us to go each weekend and it got old fast, especially in the winter as besides skiing not much to do there

money hole, feel bad going to other places as we now own a cottage so less travel

I have a plex on the Montreal Island. My tenet texted me at 5am asking me for a plumber to unclog a toliet. I proceeded to ask her what the exact problem was....she told me that her 2 year old son put wipes down the toilet and clogged it.  


Im usually pretty forgiving since this is a young mother (whose a Nurse) with a young child thats living with her boyfriend (who is an apprentice Plumber and im assuming the father).

But this request seems pretty basic....her own boyfriend is a (apprentice) plumber and can easily fix this problem that they caused themselves.   


So my question to Reddit, is this my problem as a landlord or is it the Tenets? I find this a pretty ridiculous request for potentially a small issue.

From what I've been researching I understand it is very rare to overturn and apply to have the Non-PSW changed to residential. As for PSW land no chance to ever change it to buildable land.

My question is amongst some 10 good acres there is non psw and psw land around the good residential / buildable property.

x3rbpe,RealEstateCanada,1662090291.0,"Hi Reddit!

I got a wholesaler question regarding in the Montreal area.

So here is the context/story without giving specific details.

My father in law is an RBQ contractor and I invest in real estate. Usually I buy a property and my FIL, takes his team and renovates the property, then i rent it out, refinance‚Ä¶the whole BRRR strategy while providing continuous business for my FIL and expanding our real estate portfolio.

Anyways my father in law got a call to build a staircase for a single detached homes sitting on 5500 square feet of land. My father in law went to speak with the owner who is 72 years old, has cancer and taking chemotherapy‚Ä¶and during the discussion the owner mention that he needs the money and can‚Äôt really afford to fix the house and wants to move into a condo fast.

So of course my father mention that I would probably be interested. My father in law offered $380k, we pay the notary, no inspection and new certificate of location (owner has one from 1986).

When this deal came to me, I noticed that it was in a hot area in Montreal‚Ä¶.the land alone is worth $100/sqft.

The house sitting on the land is a dump. I wouldn‚Äôt say it needs a tear down but it needs a lot of love and is outdated.

So my idea was to make a contract for the purchase of $380k and sell the contract $170k‚Ä¶($380k + $170k = $550k). I believe $550k because the land is worth that much. Homes in the area go for around $750-$900k, lower end ones are outdated.

I personally have my money tied up on a current renovation project and my income-to-debt ratio is high because of the renovation cost and my father in law money is also tied up..

We don‚Äôt want to miss out on an opportunity and I researched wholesaling. Basically, I can sell the offer of $380k for $170k but not quite sure how I go about it, so here are my questions haha


- I assume I have to write a promise to purchase for the price of $380k to the owner 

- can I go to these ‚Äúcash for homes‚Äù businesses such as:

https://www.montrealhousebuyer.ca/?gclid=CjwKCAjwsMGYBhAEEiwAGUXJaftHp6fUb5TfQckZFySG-2LK8LBFA-K2eUeaTEhDwaRnQL73bBGO6RoCFioQAvD_BwE

- if I can go to this kind of buisness, can I offer the contract? How do I get a buisness to not go behind my back and talk to the owner directly and potentially steal the deal?

- does the same apply for any developer or ‚Äúinterested investor‚Äù

- basically, I‚Äôm trying to do this with little money, I can‚Äôt afford the downpayment but I can spend $10k-$20k to get this deal done.

- i obtained the original permits, zoning papers, expropriation papers etc from the borough. Everything looks goood and developers can build provided they don‚Äôt exceed 30% of the land.

- should I consult a real estate lawyer for this?

If anyone has any insight, I would appreciate it and I‚Äôll pay for a beer, scotch or whatever they like!! haha",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/x3rbpe/how_does_wholesaling_in_montrealquebec_work/,How does Wholesaling in Montreal/Quebec work?,,3,4,0.8

i was going to list this around 1100 a month as a long term rental but i could make that back if i rent it at least 15 days a month which seems doable.

just never did short term vacation rental before, always just rent 1 year leases with renewal.

curious if i can get more data about my area, see if they are being rented or how much to charge ect?

is it a lot more work? usually i just find a tenant sign a lease with some conditions to fix or paint certain things and then i only get contacted if they need a plumber or electrician for something.

the place is rent ready would just need to add like 5k of stuff to fill the places ex beds, kitchenware, tv ect.

what is your experience with air bnb's in the city? where can i get data about rental rates ect?

i just hand over the keys, take a few calls a month and problem solved. 

they can give some tips how to renovate the place make it more interesting get higher rents

with current listing rents: -200 with better rents 100 a month

maybe we hire them just to get everything running and then let them go with 3 months notice.

I'm looking at two places in my price range, but have both been first tenanted after Nov 15th 2018. I'm wondering if this alone means that they'd be exempt from rent control guidelines. 

The RE agent I'm dealing with seems to think that if we aren't the **first** tenants to occupy the property, then the property is NOT exempt from rent control (meaning that rent control shall apply). 

However, the language isn't very clear and it seems that there's an 50/50 interpretation where - as long as the property was first occupied after Nov 15th 2018, then it's exempt from rent control, with no discernment as to whether the current tenants are the first tenants or not.

Does anyone have experience with this or know with clarity how rent control guidelines apply to properties constructed and first tenanted after Nov 15th 2018, where the current tenants are not the first tenants? Please help, thank you very much.

&#x200B;

***Details on the guidelines:***

  
  [Residential rent increases | ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca/page/residential-rent-increases) 

* New buildings, additions to existing buildings and most new basement apartments that are occupied for the first time for residential purposes after November¬†15,¬†2018 are exempt from rent control.

*Despite the section below this line, from the link above, calling the LTB was fruitless, and I was just told that I'd have to ask a lawyer.*

**Resolving issues about rent control**

As a tenant or a landlord, you can¬†[contact the Landlord and Tenant Board](https://tribunalsontario.ca/ltb/contact/)¬†to determine whether a unit is exempt from the rent increase guideline.

To show that a unit is exempt from rent control, landlords can:

* include an additional term¬†[under section¬†15 of the lease](https://www.ontario.ca/page/guide-ontarios-standard-lease-newcomers#section-2)¬†stating that the unit is exempt from the rent increase guideline
* keep records that prove the exemption ‚Äì in case the tenant asks, or there is a dispute

&#x200B;

**RTA:**

 [Law Document English View | Ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/06r17#BK8) 

*Warning: This section goes all the way to the end of the post; it's just copy & paste of what the relevant sections from the RTA seem to be. I find it very difficult to read and navigate, and trying to do so over and over for the last few days has not brought me any clarity.*

**Transition rules**

(7) The following rules apply on and after the commencement date with respect to a rental unit, if subsection (2) or (3) applies to the rental unit and the unit is subject to a tenancy in respect of which a tenancy agreement was entered into before that date but after November 15, 2018:

vvycp0,RealEstateCanada,1657479478.0,"Hi all,

I am currently in early stages of finding a larger place in Montreal. So far, I have a pre-approval to help guide my in terms of affordability in my search, but I do not have a RE agent (was planning on avoiding using one) and I have not put my current place on the market.

I have a few questions as I have visited a few places already and have found some actual solid options earlier than I expected.

1) How can I assess whether I am going to be ripped off or not? How can I factor in location, potential repairs, renovations needed, square footage, rooms.... all of that. Should I really be getting an agent?

2) If I get an agent to help me buy, do I have to use them to sell my current place too? 

3) Its also possible for me to use the seller's agent to buy, but I can only imagine that this is a bad idea and conflict of interest?

4) If I like a place in my current search, how can I put an offer without having a sale on my current place? I need the equity as a large portion of the down payment.

I have recently purchase a home close to Montreal. Maybe my agent forgot to advise me of this, also I missed paying much attention to it on the papers as my knowledge of French isn't great. I just found this at the notary that there is a clause on the property that I need to give access to Hydro Quebec when they want to make repairs or install any of their equipment. Just wondering how common is this and also if this clause greatly reduces home value. Or if there are any other issues with it. 

Thank you

Also, Happy Canada day :)

**Translation -** The purchaser declares to have been advised that a regulation allows Hydro QC, without servitude or authorization at the place it determines on the building, to occupy a part of the building subject hereof for purposes installation of the circuits, poles and equipment (overhead or underground) necessary for the connection and the network.

In addition, the acquirer declares to have been advised that an immovable may therefore be assigned rights in favor of hydro-Quebec without the consent of the owner and without any entry being made in the land register, when it is the responsibility of the purchaser to inquire with Hydro QC to know the nature and location and that he must respect the standards which are usually attached to the easements of Hydro QC

I have experience with doing renovations (Kitchens, bathrooms, plumbing, garage remodel etc). Thankfully, my father in law is a contractor and has helped me expand my real estate portfolio..

That being said, these Reno‚Äôs I have done were always in the $40k-$60k range.

I see a house in the West Island of Montreal that‚Äôs selling for approx $750k with its original build (1960s era). My realtor (Uncle) sold a comparable home for $1.1M on the same street, just this week.

So I was looking into getting into this flip with my father in law but I would estimate that it would likely take $150-$200k in renovation.

Ideally, I would put 20% down payment, but would a major bank finance the renovation if I submitted them a plan, quotes and time lines? 

I have no issue using the HELOC in my other building but I don‚Äôt want to stretch myself too thin. Essentially, we would update the kitchen, all 3 bathrooms, landscape and put in good floors etc‚Ä¶but would like to leverage the banks money to get the Reno‚Äôs done and flip to make $150k-$200k in profit  once this is all done.

uswwsm,RealEstateCanada,1652940847.0,"We are thinking about moving and it is very much at the early stage. Partly because mortgage renewal is coming up at end of year and partly because I may have family moving here and thinking they can stay with us. I have contacted a broker and waiting for info so I have made some assumptions for the new purchase.

I used our basic income to calculate affordability, plus 100% condo rental income for qualifying purpose in all scenarios; duplex income included only for cash flow purpose. Estimate expenses\* for new house is $3500/mo.

We can easily get additional flex income of \~200-400 a month (net) if needed, possibly 700 if I get more consistent hours. If and when family moves in and help contribute to expenses, it would probably be around 1000 - but that would be at least a year out. We can probably get roommates too but husband really prefers not, so I would say that is off the table unless we are depleting our savings. Or unless there is a completely separate suite, which is a possibility but not my preference.

If we move, another car is likely needed, but this is on the high end of our budget (Ioniq 5). We are also considering getting a Civic or something of that class, which would reduce loan requirement but still consuming petrol gas. Worst case, I can transit to work (\~$120 for bus pass).

Not sure if I have missed much in the budgets. Household items, personal care, clothes, gifts, maintenance, entertainment would come from net. We probably have 6 months supply of cleaning supplies and a year supply of major personal care items, and we honestly will not \*need\* to buy clothes for at least 2 years. Dining out is our biggest entertainment expense, which can easily be controlled.

What have I missed? What are your thoughts and advice?

I'd appreciate any insight! Thanks in advance.

I understand its a small sample size but still a bit alarming. On the surface, it seems concerning for a conflict of interest as both agents stand to make more commission with a higher selling price.

Total 30k in TFSA. 

Saving grow at 1000 to 1500 a month. Plan to be at 70k plus by October.

Father passed away in October 21.  Upto 250k available once those proceeds are settled ( 200 available after July, rest in October)

I own the land on my side and my half behind the house, our neighbor owns the land on his side and his half behind the house and we both share the driveway (limited common property) in the front.

My friend bought a duplex property where the tenants were paying rent which is 50-60% as compared to market and he knew that it is lower than market and still purchased the property.

Now his mortgage went up considerably so it will be hard to pay if tenants continue to pay the same rent (I understand it is not tenants mistake). He understands that he knew this risk and he took it

I told him that it is really hard for landlords to evict tenants unless someone is repossessing. What are the best solutions?

* Friend have a wife and a kid
* Tenants are a couple with 2 kids
   * pay on time - no conflicts
   * Lease renews July 1st
   * living from last 5-6 years - he is not sure as he bought last year
* Friend being landlord and his tenants are nice

I believe he have a couple of options like 

1. increase the rent as per Quebec's rent increment (2.3%?) and scuk it up with the payments.
2. give tenants a 6m+ notice for evictions (might have to pay for moving costs or compensation) and maybe re-rent it later - this might go to tribunal. 
   1. He might not do that as it might be counted as ""Bad Person"" or ""Bad Landlord"".
3. discuss with bank and readjust mortgage - (like 25 to 30 year amortization? not sure if this is an option)

Over the holidays, I talked with my family about these two options and they all seem to be saying that renting is a waste of money and that I'm just making the owner rich. To be honest, I thought they were right but pushed a little bit more my research and data say otherwise.

I did a realistic scenario on a site that calculates the difference between the two scenarios, and renting seems much more favorable. (750 000$ difference)

My family doesn't have a finance background, and I think it's more ignorance. I would appreciate your help to find out if I am missing something. I would really appreciate your comments.

107q2nb,RealEstateCanada,1673298496.0,"Hi,

I rent a flat in a triplex on the third floor in Ottawa. The tenants in the basement smoke cigarettes so much it is disgusting the smoke ramps up the walls and come into my unit causing headaches, dry eyes etc.

Our contracts says this is a smokeless building, but they won't stop. The landlord whom I know well lives on the second floor and is someone who really tries to avoid conflicts and does want to handle the situation with the other tenants. I've spoke with them, but they are the kind of people who don't go outside and just smoke and watch tv 24/7. They won't stop.

As a tenant myself, what are my rights here? Can I fill a complaint myself against the other tenants?

Or can my landlord do something? He is old and afraid to go through court but I can handle it for him.

Cheers,

We had the finances and couldn't pass up the opportunity given the location and quality of the home. Yes the market was going bananas at that time, but we are confident that we payed a fair market value for this home even in the face of the current market (another unit in our complex just sold a couple months ago for 315k).

In early 2022 the death of a close family member left us with a very large sum of inheritance, which we used to completely pay off our mortgage, with a small bit leftover for savings.

We have our first child coming this month, and also have a dog. Our townhome is amazing but eventually will be too small for us. It will be plenty for us while the baby is still immobile, but once he's a toddler running around, especially if we are planning to have a 2nd child, we're definitely going to need to upgrade at some point in the next few years.

I know that there were a ton of new homebuyers in 2020/2021, and I figure that there's a good chance they a) bought detached at ridiculous valuations, and b) won't be able to keep up their mortgage with higher rates. As such, my theory is that in 2025 or so, when mortgages are expiring, there's going to be a ton of listings as people try to escape their mortgages, ultimately pushing the market down as they panic and accept low offers.

I currently rent in Southern Ontario, but I work remotely. I have lived in Alberta and Quebec in the past, and I would not mind moving to these particular provinces.

Ontario in general is pretty much out of question for me. House prices could fall by 1/3, and that would still be expensive.

I have been eyeing either Edmonton or Calgary, because there is a good balance between conveniences of a large city, lower income tax bracket, supposedly lower housing price and not very shitty healthcare (unlike Atlantic provinces, for example).

* 2+ bedroom house or townhouse
* Around 300K
* Location: Not very picky about neighborhood, as long as it is quiet and there is access to high-speed internet
* Year of construction: Preferably 2009 or newer
* Also no carpet anywhere. I thought it would not be much of a problem while searching, but people can be pretty gross. I would only consider one if it came with a steep discount for my troubles of getting that stuff replaced.

xd72bl,RealEstateCanada,1663074362.0,"Hi all found this Sub yesterday and hoping some veterans in Real Estate investing can offer me some advice while I am seeking my first property. Not sure if I am being my own enemy and being to conservative or fair in some circumstances. 

I have been looking for a Duplex for a while and recently found one on the Market and done what I feel was proper Due Diligence, desire to have a Cap rate of 10% or close to it. 

Property details. 

Location: Brockville ON List $399K - Fully Rented @ $2826 Net monthly revenue $33,912 PA 

$33,9112 / $399,000 = % 8.4 (Current tenants month to month with rental increase due Year End) Both tenants Signed up After November 15th 2018. Excellent I thought this is worth looking in to.   

I worked my finance #s using 6% on a 30yr 5 Year Fixed Rate. P&I =$1,914 P/M + other costs Tax, INS, Utilities, Snow and Garden Services + $806 P/M Total Monthly costs = $ 2,720. Cash Flow $176 PM (3.8%) 

I figure I would offer Between $350k-$375k thus New Mortgage and Carry Costs = $2,605 Cash Flow Now $221 (8.4%) at the higher end. 

Property Sold for $430k., I am struggling to clearly understand why an investor would take the property at this price. It dose not make sense to me., $33,912 / $430,000 7.8% appears OK But when i add Mortgage and carry costs $2,063 + $806 = $2,869 / $2,826 -1.5% -$43 Assuming 20% DP Even at 5% Mortgage rate would offer + 6.5% CAP 

Is it normal to buy at a low cap rate and then buy at close to break even and simplify notify of a rent increase to make up the difference? My understanding as they signed after Nov 15th 2018 there is no rent controls in place beyond 90 days notice of the increase coming. Not something I think serves the area well and I believe the existing tenants to be older and most likely on a fixed income. 

Am I being to picky or conservative with things such as using 6% to run my numbers., am I putting to much care in to the financial health or wellbeing of the existing tenants? At the $430k and using my desired 10% Cap rape I would be raising rents to $3,155 (+11-12%) again my understanding being this is allowable as original lease signed on both units after Nov 15th 2018. Does this also mean you can continue to raise at will? 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated., Especially within Ontario. My goal is to build up multiple properties, and not gouge or significantly have high carry costs because of over paying for a property and forcing high rents on those wishing for a nice place to live. But the main question I have is am I the problem.

I am having a tough time wrapping my head around this.

&#x200B;

My income is $110K base with 35% bonus, but since I recently started only the $110K is being used to calculate my mortgage approval. No other debts except current mortgage. About $40K liquid in my account (TFSA+chequing+RRSP) equally split.

&#x200B;

Property 1 (I own):

Approx. sale price possible: $350K

Mortgage remaining: $180K

Potential rent: $1.7K

Other monthly costs: $200 for property tax, $230 condo fees, $30 insurance, $30 electricity, $40 internet

&#x200B;

Property 2 (I want to buy):

Cost: $685K

&#x200B;

My bank currently sent me a pre-approval for a mortgage of $560K, which is basically my income x5. However it even states that its dependent on the unconditional sale of my current property.

I also read, however, that lenders should be willing to give BOC qualifying rate x debt requested as long as its under 44% of the gross income.

In this case, I wonder if I could take a HELOC, or the equity out through a refinance, of my current place (about $136K or so) to down-pay the other property. This would leave me with the following:

136K+180K+560K debt = 876K, x 5.25% = 46K yearly interest = 3.8K monthly interes /0.44 = 8.7K gross needed. I am at 9.2K gross without my bonus. Should I be OK to continue with this?

This doesn't even factor in

1) Rental income from keeping the first place

2) My girlfriend will be paying ""rent"", about half of everything minus mortgage principal

Our mortgage can be approved for $1.25M  We‚Äôre running a few scenarios trying to determine the best balance of affordability/comfort vs return on investment

1) Fraser Valley area in BC (decent quality home, we would live on main/upper level, and have a 2bd mortgage helper on the bottom floor knocking off $1750-$1900 from the mortgage.) The area has appreciated well in the past few years, so we‚Äôre expecting a decent correction to hit in the coming months.

2) Okanagan Area in BC (Vernon or Coldstream, a bit older homes but great views and could use the mortgage helper suite as an Airbnb/short term rental during peak months‚Ä¶ not sure how fall/winter occupancy rate looks like though‚Ä¶Long term rentals on a 2bd easily go for $2000/mnth) The Kelowna area in particular has also seen a major upswing in prices over the past few years and is bound to see a correction. 

3) Move to Alberta, Edmonton area (live in a top quality built home purchased around the $625k mark. Luxury finishes, all the bells and whistles. Use the remaining proceeds from our condo sale to buy back into the BC market later in the year with a purchase of another condo or older home, generating enough income to pay its own mortgage. 


Obviously the pro‚Äôs to owning in BC is the appreciation and value of the homes. You won‚Äôt be seeing the same returns in Alberta. With that said, we‚Äôd have no choice but to live with tenants in a older home. 

The pro‚Äôs to Alberta is the size and finishing of the homes. They‚Äôre luxurious and provide a quality home life without the need for tenants. Cons = no real appreciation in home value.

just when i run the numbers its not a great deal, but what i am buying is to have 2/3 units available to renovate and rent at market.

the deal is 660k for 35.4k revenue, just this  place will need good amount of reno:

\-new roof 22k

\-basement reno, move the kitchen and add a bed room 10k to 20k

\-new floor (current is ceramic from the 60's would just cover with a vinyl plank)  5k

\-move the hot water tanks and split, 5k

\-paint and maintenance 5k

\-balconies and stairs, need grinding and repaint 5k

so around 65k to get this rental ready.

agent thinks we can negotiate down to 600k, yet with just the mortgage, taxes, no pm, no budget for maintenance ect. this is a -200 a month deal.

overall not ecstatic or anything, though compared to people asking 25x revenue this is a better deal. i just worry that we do go full on recession and prices go back to 2018 levels where getting 12x revenue was possible.

&#x200B;

when talking to my broker he brought up the MLI select 50 year mortgage, pretty much its meant to keep rents low on larger multi family. ex in my case current rents are 515/month while market would be closer to 1200, with this mortgage type i would be limited to raise rents to 1080/month over next 10 years then i could raise rents to market, but before then could not exceed 1080 a month. 

overall the building needs work; new balconies, roof, inside updates (bathrooms and kitchen are from 50's), just still for the price under 800k its a good deal but the rents are very low and the tenants are old so probably fixed income so pretty much will stay that way till they move out/die.

the mortgage difference is 25 years would be \~3600 a month while 50 years is \~2900 a month 

just im kinda worried about having a 50 year mortgage, seems like i'll be just paying interest year after year, bearly cash flowing if at all, just to own a 6 plex for the price of a triplex. 

location is decent just i worry about the whole having a 50 year mortgage and the implications of classifying the building as low income housing and not being able to remove that after, pretty much even if i do get new tenants i'm still stuck renting it cheap for the next 10 years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/vm5jb1/mli_select_cmhc_backed_50_year_mortgage_for_low/,MLI Select cmhc backed 50 year mortgage for low income multi family?,,2,10,0.75

Keep in mind I'm going to be putting 20% down, which my broker informed me makes the lowest fixed rates available to me a little higher than some of the ones I see online. Now that I'm actually about to close on a house, he's hinting at fixed being a better option; I know there are interest rate hikes upcoming, but is it really better to lock in at 4.3% than to risk it with much lower variable rates? Basically, in my understanding, the variable rate would have to rise up above 6% to make me break even with the fixed rates over the course of the next 5 years, which would be pretty substantial. But then again, I'm hearing about interest rate hikes that are guaranteed to happen. But it's sounding like 1-2% increase by the end of the year, in which case I'd be about level with the fixed rate but would have started off lower at least - though there would still be 4 more years of possible increases. There are so many differing possibilities!! I was also thinking that a shorter term fixed rate be a smart move? Those come in closer to 3% for 2 or 3 years.

IF these aren't mentioned in the listing is it fair to assume these items haven't been dealt with?

It'd be easy to ask the listing realtor, but who knows how good their knowledge of the house is.

Wiring and asbestos aren't things you can check yourself and I wouldn't want to put in an offer until I knew what had been done with regards to wiring and asbestos.

You can get an inspection of course, but that's just a condition of an offer as far as I'm aware - I want to know whether the asbestos has been taken out and the wiring upgraded before I put in an offer.

However, one family member has strong opinions on going to open houses vs realtor showings; they believe that open house viewings are superior and we can get more done in a day, and therefore we shouldn't be going on a long weekend because there would be fewer houses open for viewing on long weekends.

I'm buying a condo in ~~Canada~~ Saskatchewan. The seller was renting it before, but it is currently unoccupied. So the seller hasn't lived in the property, at least not in the last couple of years, as far as we were told.

When making the official offer, our realtor said to only put our initials next to the home inspection as a purchase condition (which is standard), but said to skip others. I'm OK skipping most of them except for the seller's disclosure. 

In the few home purchases I've been involved with, I've only seen this be skipped on a rent-to-own because the buyer had already been living in the property for a year or two. Furthermore, a quick internet search shows that the seller's disclosure is normally skipped only for estate sales or foreclosures (because the owner knows nothing about the property). But for seller-landlords, it is normal to ask for it. Even if they haven't lived in the property, they would inspect it when a tenant leaves (or even when it is rented out).

So, is it reasonable to ask for the seller's disclosure if the seller is a landlord? Why would my agent be pushing for fewer disclosures than for more info from the seller? In what cases is it common to skip this?

Thanks in advance!

\----------------

**Edit to add**: I would like to add some more info based on the comments I got so far. 

1. The other conditions are, for example, electrical inspection, municipal compliance report, GST opinion, environmental report, septic/sewer inspection, etc.
2. I am in a multiple-offer scenario, but the other offer will very likely fall through (As our realtor explained).
3. I assumed that the laws or standard practices about this were the same across Canada. I added the province above. 
4. I'm more concerned that, because it's a small town, my agent knows the seller or their agent and they are avoiding sharing certain info that is in the disclosures; or that my agent wants to make the purchase happen at all costs; so my agent is giving me excuses why there won't be a seller's disclosure. I'm not saying that this is what's happening, but I'm trying to understand why my agent is steering me away from getting more info.

I know the equity on the townhouse won‚Äôt appreciate for a long time lol and we‚Äôre probably in another 2008 right now so I can maybe sell it for a bit higher then what I paid or for even if I decide to list as soon as it‚Äôs built. another thing I was considering was to move into the townhouse and live there whilst I turn my primary properly into a rental asset. The home is paid off and can be a another stream of income for me to use liquid purposes?. That way I know I will be able to handle the payments and hope somewhere down the line in a few years I can turn a profit.

107hiyo,RealEstateCanada,1673278980.0,"i listed my triplex in Montreal for 1 year now, and near no real interesting offers except a few lowball.

i have to either decide to re list with the same agent, not sell or, maybe go with a different agent. 

just seems like it wont make a difference, as all agents are on MLS buyers ask their agent to contact your selling agent to visit and any agent can do that.

so overall I'm not sure what to do, my agent has been doing this for a long time (20+ years) now so is knowledgeable and i have used him to buy 3 properties, and seems to negotiate well and get the deal closed. its not like i have a rookie who will fudge something in the closing. 

if i go with another agent, what are they going to do more? they will change the sign and wait for calls and do the visits same as my current agent, and i wont know them as well.

maybe they have a bigger buyer pool they represent if i were to go with a group vs an individual agent, but overall the buyers are the same right?

besides maybe a different commission % i don't see a advantage of changing my agent. 

so just asking if it will change anything?

overall i'm not in any hurry to sell and unless I'm getting close to my price its not even worth selling after paying off mortgage, capital gains, and fees. its kind of laughable that my ""profit"" pretty much is barely enough down payment to buy back another plex in the same price range.

zf8rv5,RealEstateCanada,1670436836.0,"Hello all,

As the the title says, I am looking at a property that was built in Upper Thames conservation area (Ontario) and I have some questions.

Homes around the area used to be seasonal cottages but since last year, owners have been able to access their homes all year round. 

The land looks like is leased from the conservation area and in exchange, owner gets access to water, snow removal service and amenities the association has to offer. There are no property taxes.

With this being said, mortgages on this area have to be from private lenders and not traditional lenders since the traditional loans are secured with the land, not the house.

Our cash reserves allows us to put down a 50% down payment on the property and will be able to pay down 1% of the remaining mortgage each month. We have never applied to a private lender for mortgages but our credit score is above 800 and have a good income (no debts). I am assuming the interest rate from private lenders is higher than traditional lenders.

My main questions:

\- What happens with the house if the land owners want their land back? by land owners I am assuming is the Conservation area association but not sure tbh. Worst case scenarios welcomed lol

\- What are other big disadvantages on a property like this?  


For those wondering why I am bothering with a home like this is because it faces a lake that is 10 minutes away from downtown, I would say is the perfect home for me and my family and I know homes like this don't come in the market often but not being familiar with homes in conservation areas has me thinking twice about it lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/zf8rv5/buying_a_property_in_a_conservation_area/,Buying a property in a conservation area?,,1,2,0.67

z9vrhy,RealEstateCanada,1669920025.0," I thought this was an interesting scenario. I was \*not\* clever enough to do this on purpose but one might benefit from doing so.

So, situation is that I'm making an offer on a condo. It is for me to live in after a separation and (should we reconcile) also in a good spot for a rental around lougheed mall and the new gondola base.

I had \*almost\* made an offer nearly a month ago and I had seen the place and read the strata docs. Older building, management / council seemed to have a good approach to maintenance. 120 units so fairly easy to bite off medium sized repair work on a priority basis. And it was a 3bd condo that was cheap and didn't show too well.

Why it didn't show too well was that the original listing was heavily virually staged / photo shopped and reality didn't match. The hallways were dim too. The listing agent did eventually take down and relist and skipped those photos, my offer was a few days after it was relisted. Finally, the unit was vacact and had been for a few months (condo market has been slow).

Anyways, I'm ready to make the offer. I know the rental rules have changed and that's possibly good as the rental allowance the building had was filled, but of course now I am worried about higher demand from investors. I also have a bit of a tricky finance situation in that I have a HELOC that I suspect I will need to discharge before a mortgage on this place. Because banks are slow, I put in 3 weeks for financing which I know isn't good. I also bid 20K under asking (and the asking was already lowered once). All in all, if the market has picked up with the rental change, it is a bad offer but I hope maybe the fact it's been vacant will get a quick yes.

And it did, BUT.

The seller's agent come back with, apparently normal these days, a clause that allows them to receive a new offer and force me to remove subjects in 72 hours. I say, OK, whatever, I will stay with my original offer and accept that clause. Maybe 2 weeks for financing would have had no clause, maybe not.

So, here is where the ""fishing"" analogy comes in. My offer is weak, market has just picked up for them with rental change and re-listing. They (could have, I don't really know) see my weak, long subject listing and think, this is great. We say yes to him, with the 72 hour clause, and go talk to other interested buyers and try and get them to up the ante and get the place. They can't of course spell out my offer they just hint hint nudge nudge to get a higher price with better subjects.

And so, in only a few hours after accepting my offer, they have another. I try to help my cause by removing a few subjects my agent had thrown in but I didn't care about, and maybe even changed the subject removal to 2 weeks (can't recall) but didn't change the price or any other dates. That didn't work, the next day they trigger the 72 hour countdown.

Now, all of this I played ""straight"". I do have a HELOC that I am worried will be an issue and in general I find banks to be slow so 3 weeks did seem a reasonable time since I hadn't gotten my ducks in a row first. But, I have other resources in my family that I could reach out to as a backup plan. So, I did. And while I am still pursuing the mortgage, bank of family will lend if the bank as issues in timing or whatever. I'm sure those issues can be resolved, but you never know on timing.

So, I removed the subjects. Place is mine. 20K under \*and\* all the dates in place to give the financing time anyways.

I post this as interesting because I have previously seen conditional offer situations but this time-forced conditional offer thing is new to me. And, it's was double edged sword when I thought about it. I think, suspect, that my low weak offer was accepted partly because it was weak. I wonder if the same price with cash in hand and no sujects would have been accepted.

No way of knowing, but it's something that buyers might try. Won't work with a place that is in demand....but in a buyers market it might just be a trick to try to save some cash. You can always counter / re-offer if it doesn't work. And, of course, in different circumstances it might have netted the seller more instead.

Reason why I want to purcahse a Condo as an investment in Toronto:

1. Family is here who can can act as property managers.
2. Only thing I can get a mortgage on with my salary
3. Toronto is a hub for buisnesses = great for landlording

# Here is what I considered (and I still have no clue what to do, further insights are appericaited!):

**Pros:**

\- Lock in current rates, don't need to be scared of being priced out in the future again

\- Can use it to leverage further properties via HELOC or re-finacning, et if real estate appericiates.

\- I calculated that the cashflow is not significant \~1k per month when paying for 30 year mortgage/HOA with \~50% downpayment. This is because of Canada taking 25% of rental income when in US, and the current tenant market prices.

**Cons:**

\- Lose out on oppurtunity cost on purchasing real esate in the U.S via TN visa. Need talk to imigration lawyer about this as doing so possibly can revoke my TN visa.

\- Lose out on oppurtunity cost on investing on ETFs if say real estate on the long term does not appericiate compared to ETFs due to us being already in a real estate bubble where local salaries cannot are greatly  outpaced by current prices.

\- I have to pay for a mortgage in Toronto and rent in the U.S. If there is a tenant vacancy, it could be a sticky situation.  However, I don't see that as a significant issue since Toronto is a ""hub"" for everything and that it's very unlikely. With the average salary in the U.S, I do have wiggle room to pay a few months of mortgage on my own. Say  3 months to be conservative.

We are exploring two options. 

1 - Continuing to renovate this place to make it a legal duplex (could be another 20-30k), then trying to save money for our next place in the process. We have two kids so this will take years. The house will need necessary work over the next little bit. House has quirks. 

2 - The other option which I think gets us there faster, is to sell our house (300k mortgage) for 650-750(Kitchener, which frees up money we would need to renovate the a new place, and of course to generate down payment money for a more suitable duplex house. By approximate math 700k-300k=400k-170k down payment-50closing = 180k left to renovate, and the remainder is the start of our next down payment.

1. It is a 10-year-old building and there is no depreciation report, but one has been ordered on December 2021. It still hasn't come yet. Does anyone know if it is common for a 10-year low rise building to not have any depreciation report?
2. This is a low rise building with 65 units, no amenities and commercial stores on the ground floor. Strata fees are really low \~$290. The concern I have is when I read the strata report I noticed that the contingency reserve fund is only \~$40000. There were no big projects that happened in the documents aside from adding more lights to the common area that cost $14000 but they split the cost and only took 5% from the contingency fund and the rest was a special levy. Is this CRF a healthy fund considering how low the strata fees are?
3. There is no restriction at all to rentals, I am concerned that the strata council are mostly landlords looking to keep the strata fees low and holding off on upkeeping the building. A few times in the minutes, they mention things just miraculous gets fixed: parking gate not working, then next month's minutes it is working fine so no need to fix and leaking to the parking from a broken pavement in the courtyard but somehow overtime it's slowed down. It seems like they don't actually put money to fixing issues. The only thing I see in the documents that recently passed are carpet cleaning and done twice a year which they take from the CRF.

My plan is to reside there for at least five years. 

I met with a realtor and viewed a sampling of properties. Supply seems plentiful, average age on market is 180 days. She said whenever buyers appear there is always new supply, so there hasn't been any upward movement in prices for the past half decade. 

She also said Realtors are trying to price things in such a way that they will sell between 93-95% of ask. Of the properties we looked at, half were vacant. 

My concern is that if market conditions stay the same, we may have an issue selling in a few years time. 

I'm wondering how acceptable it is to put in offers that are significantly lower than ask? My thinking is that if we can get something below market it will provide us the opportunity to sell for lower when the time comes. If something's been sitting for over a year vacant, how low can an offer go?

Are there other risks with buying a property that's been on the market I'm not foreseeing? My obvious concern is if it has been vacant it there could be a lot of things not maintained or cared for.

This is my first home purchase, although the location is great, condo fees are \~$100-300 higher than other townhomes in the area.  Are these massive red flags that should be avoided?

Does having someone professionally read the condo documents make a difference?  Or are all these points so glaringly obvious that their expertise isn't needed?

He'd like to get his downpayment back but doesn't care to get the full value of the home. I am able to get the money to pay him his downpayment.

I don't qualify for the mortgage on my own and my father can sign on with me. My mortgage broker said the bank (Scotiabank) can make the change for a fee (she estimated $500) but it shouldn't trigger a full refinancing, I should be able to keep my terms and interest rate. 

I just had a call with a Scotiabank advisor and they said they likely WILL have to close the mortgage (incurring penalties) and refinance. They said they'll look into it and get back to me. 

I'm trying really hard to keep my home and my ex has been gracious enough to work with me on it. I currently have prime minus 1% on a variable mortgage.

My share is only 0.33% as I put my name down to get them approved for mortgage. My dad is 65 yo and just got let go of his job and my mom only earns $20k/year. I am paying $800/month right now to help them out with mortgage since I live with them. I am now concerned they will ask me to pay majority of mortgage (around $2000-2500/month) which I really don't want to do as my share only 0.33% and I don't even have my own principal residence yet. I have a rental condo so due to that and my name on parent's mortgage my ability to borrow more mortgage is reduced and it will be challenging to buy a $1.5 million home in BC in a couple of years when I have saved enough for mortgage. My parents already have another investment home which is generating $500 positive cash flow per month. I have tried to convince them to sell one home to 3rd party or even to me but they are only agreeable to have me increase my share in current home to 50%. I won't be able to get my name removed from mortgage now as parents income too low to get approved on their own. So I can't force them to sell and since my name is on mortgage I will be obligated to make mortgage payments atleast to some extent if not the whole payment. I feel they are dumping this on me for their own benefit. Current home bought for $1.1 mill and now worth $1.6 million so I will need to pay them $800k if my share is 50% and this is doable. But long term this type of arrangement may cause issues especially if I move out with new partner as then I will have to pay for new home and current home's mortgage too.

I am asking this question here because I don't have anyone who can help me in Canada on the process. I have done this once before when buying a condo, but I had started the process with a real estate agent before finding the one I wanted to buy.

In this case, I just found my perfect ideal unit in the same building I currently live in on centris. It is beautiful, it is my dream, and I don't want to miss it! Resisting the urge to knock on their door and ask to buy it vs. going through their agent ;)

I am currently at the step 0 stage of the process. I sent a request to get a pre-approval for my mortgage, and I don't have an agent right now.

1) Do I need an agent myself to start the process?

2) My current mortgage is currently quite small, and if I rent it out I am very much in positive cash flow (mortgage payment about $700 a month, $280 of it is interest per month). Does this therefore count as a positive on getting a new additional mortgage, or do I actually need to rent for a while first for this to happen? This will decide if I need to sell my current place to buy this new one. 

3) What is the next step after I get my pre-approval?

The house was tenanted on a month-to-month lease. When the lease started, the tenant paid a deposit for last month's rent.  I've served the tenant the standard N12 form, with 60 days notice from the start of the next rental period. Rent is typically paid on the first of each month, so I gave notice this week for vacancy by June 30th. The tenant was also informed, in writing, that their ""Last month's rent"" deposit would be applied to June's rent, and that May's rent would be covered by the single month's rent owed to them as compensation.

The tenant is stating that they might have a place to move on May 1st, and feels that if they do, they are entitled to a payment of one month's rent. I'm not sure if this is the case. There is a clause on the N12 form that states ""You \[the tenant\] can terminate the tenancy sooner than the date set out in this notice as long as you give the landlord at least 10 days' notice that you intend to move out of the rental unit."" But it does not address how the compensation applies in this scenario.

I'm not sure how to proceed, and am having a hard time finding a clear answer to how the law applies to this case. My goal is not to swindle the tenant out of what is owed to them, but I'd rather not pay anything that is not owed.

We‚Äôre first time home buyers. We had our home inspection completed and thought, due to some minor issues found, that we could leverage the sellers to have the cost brought down a bit, or have the sellers fix said issues before we took possession. Our realtor found out there were other offers, which I guess is common, but also that one of the other parties had done a home inspection and their inspector supposedly didn‚Äôt find any issues. We are a little confused. Why would another party pay for an inspection when this deal is practically done? There was no communication from us to our realtor that we were considering backing out. Is it common for others to waste their money in the off chance a deal falls through, or did their realtor blow smoke up our ass to avoid dropping the price? Long winded, sorry.

$600 deal fee for first 6 transactions  -1 

GCI cap at $55K then the commission split goes to 90/10 +1 

Large network of agents (50+) -1 

Lots of opportunities for Open Houses +1

Not many leads are being dispersed amongst the sales team as this location does not prioritize e-leads. -1

Larger team = Less duty time available. More regimented in terms of scheduling. -1

Coldwell Banker 

75/25 Split -1 

No deal feels. 1% yearly royalties on GCI +1 

GCI cap at $100K, then the commission split goes to 90/10 -1 

In-house marketing packages, complimentary for the first year. Content creation, social media postings, etc. +1 

Smaller team, with only 6 agents trading locally which means I would come up in the rotation for leads more frequently. +1 

Not as much opportunity for Open Houses locally... Lots of open house opportunities are available in neighboring cities, however. -1 

Satellite office in a great location - Broker indicated that I would basically be able to make my own schedule as pretty much the only on-duty agent. The location of the office is great, and they've done a great job of making it look inviting. +1

this is the first floor of a house (2000 sqft) build in the early 1900's renovations needed:

* new insulation of floors and walls, currently maybe 1inch of foam in some walls
* 6 new windows, current are drafty 
* new front and back doors, same issue as the windows 
* new electrical panel, new wiring 
* remove existing gas heating and replace with base board, could keep gas worst case just having temp control in each room would be nice as currently theirs only 1 thermostat. 
* foundation issues, house is held up on both sides by neighbors but ball will roll on floors so house has moved over the years.
* possibly add a basement, currently earth basement 3ft deep would need to solidify the foundation as well
* central air

seeing easy 100k in reno's, not including basement that could be 250k+ 

my worry is financing, as the family has no intrest in heloc or refi to finance these renos so we would have to get a loan ourselves and a mortgage would be much easier.

-The incoming ban on foreign investors

-More housing supply with Greenbelt out of way by Doug Ford

-Government spending increasing because more people are getting unemployed, and also because of those that don't want to work

-Interest rate will likely slow down from 2024

-500,000 immigrants being added to Canada every year, with most concentrating in Toronto or Vancouver

-Lot of owners seem to be waiting till 2025 to sell their house

I am about to inherit an acre of land close to Muskoka cottage country. The only thing I know about this land is there is hydro on the property line and that the road is maintained year round.

My first and only thought was to build a cabin that my family and I could use and for short term / aribnb rentals. Comparable, 800-1000ft cottages sold in the area between 550K-650K.

My question is -- what are some of the things to consider before I start diving deeper into this? What is an avg cost per sq ft to build a winterized cottage in the cottage country now adays? Also, I'd need a septic tank and a well dug -- what are the costs associated with that?

Details of building/unit: newly built (less than 3 years) condo in Montreal, Quebec, Canada built by the same developer/builder who has built many projects in my area. This building has 10 stories/floors and I purchased a corner unit on the top floor (10th floor). The boilers and ac unit are not located on the roof of my unit. 

Details of noises: most of the banging noises come from the ceiling of my condo. It is not one fixed location. The banging noises happen in my living roof ceiling, in my bedroom ceiling at different locations. Sometimes one noise at a time, sometimes multiple noises at different locations at the same time. I have found no pattern, the noises happen any time of the day, it is almost 24/7 with different frequencies and loudness. 

I have also heard noises from what it sounds like...the pipes (inside of the walls) connecting my washer. 

third: I heard electric buzzing waves when I go on my balcony.  


for videos: youtobe user:  condoownerquebec 

right now I contacted the board and management company. They basically told me I cant prove the sounds are not caused by an issue within my unit and refuse to send people to fix. because they are only responsible for common areas, and the sounds from my unit could be caused by water pipes inside of my unit (inside the wall next to washer)   


My question is, 1:    if they dont send someone to find the problem, how can anyone know if the problem is caused by what's in my unit or outside my unit?   


2: if the issue is caused by a problem in the water pipe within the wall next to the washer, is that considered common area or within my unit? it is inside of walls between my bedroom and living room.  


3: is this considered a construction defect or hidden defect if I wish to go after the builder? because these 2 terms have different warranty periods.   


4: if I have to hire someone to find the issue, who should i hire? i dont even know if it's ventilation, plumbing or electricity. I cant see where is problem is it is behind walls and concrete

zihmof,RealEstateCanada,1670738965.0,"So here's what my wife and I did to help select a realtor, and I just wanted to kind of see what people's reaction to it is. 

We're first-time home-buyers, pretty nervous about the experience, pretty leery of realtors in general, but we decided to basically write up everything we're looking for in a property in a about a page and a half of an email, along with the listings we've seen that match our interests and some brief notes about each. 

But, near the top of the email, we said:

""We are very serious about sticking to our budget range. Despite this long list of preferences, we highly value making a good financial choice and are planning on negotiating down whatever the asking price is: we‚Äôd rather save some money by making a lowball offer and risk losing a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù property than overpay. We‚Äôre also quite willing to put in a lot of the work in finding properties ourselves, we really just need someone to facilitate viewings and write the offer. We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre a lovely person, but we are skeptical of the real estate industry and the commission-based system in general, and we dislike the idea of being pressured in any way. However, we also acknowledge we don‚Äôt have a lot of experience in doing this, so please don‚Äôt take advantage of us! We‚Äôre also looking at a wide range of realtors--there‚Äôs something like X number listed online for the our area!--so if you could entice us with some sort of cash-back offer, we‚Äôd obviously be more inclined to consider your services. We really hope we won't be a lot of work for you; but maybe everyone thinks that their first time buying property!""

So, yeah. Is that a crazy thing to do to realtors? Is it wrong to expect contracted service providers to fight for our business? 

PS:

If you're curious, within 8 hours of sending about 2 dozen emails we've gotten: two much-appreciated offers of lowered commission from people who clearly read our letter; three people who clearly didn't read our letter and just sent standard form responses; one person who misspelled my wife's name; two people were fairly salty about us straight-up asking for a discount; and two people probably read our email based on their more human-sounding responses, but didn't address the suggestion we made about reducing their commission.",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/zihmof/choosing_a_realtor/,Choosing a Realtor,,1,164,0.51
zfd63u,RealEstateCanada,1670445838.0,"Should I sell my investment property in my situation?

Canadian. Low-income self-employed (make enough to pay all my bills and save around $20K-$30K a year). No debt.

Own a duplex income property (I don't live in it), worth around $600 - $650K (a bit hard to tell in this market). $90K mortgage.  35K in cash savings, and $70K in the S&P 500 (saving up for another property).

BC has rent control, restricting the amount of rent increases (0% in 2021, 1.5% in 2022, and 2% for 2023). Currently have 2 good long-term tenants paying undermarket. I'm currently breaking even on cashflow, but with the restricted allowable rent increases and the insane increases on other bills (insurance increased by about 40%, property taxes and utilities have skyrocketed too), I'll probably start to slowly be in the negative cashflow.

The property is owned by my corporation, so capital gains would effectively be 25% here.

I've been thinking about selling it since the market peak seems to have come and gone and it is no longer cashflowing, and bill increases completely outpace allowable rent increases.

One of my hesitations is that since I am relatively low income and self employed, that it can be difficult to be secure a sizeable mortgage. But I was thinking of selling, putting into a GIC or the S&P 500, and waiting for the market to correct to where I can hopefully parlay funds into a bigger/better property that cashflows again.

My mum and I co-signed on a pre-construction with a builder for a townhouse in Milton. We plan to live in this house and by closing will have a 30+% down payment.

Anyway, we want to add him to the title now so that mortgage approval is easier. We should still be fine without him but he has a better income significantly than hers. And it would help me sleep a lot better at night if we had more borrowing power.

The builder says they will treat this as an assignment (with a high fees). My lawyer is looking into the agreement which seems to state in one clause that adding a spouse can be done without written approval but then later on in the Assignment Addendum it is more unclear.

Hey all.

I‚Äôve been hanging around here for a while and figured I‚Äôd start a thread.  I tried posting this on r/Canadahousing but was issued a permanent ban because ‚Äúreal estate investors are part of the problem‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt have a ton of guidance from outside sources so I‚Äôm hoping to get some here.

I‚Äôll start off by saying that I definitely see a lot of hate on here towards landlords and individuals who may own multiple properties (some justified and some maybe not) and I‚Äôm not trying to stir the pot at all.  I just want to share some thoughts I have and see what y‚Äôall have to say.

I‚Äôm currently 30 years old and have been investing in real estate here in Ottawa since I was 23. I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to work a decent job with a decent income that‚Äôs given me the ability to save money and also given me a very strong borrowing power when it comes to home equity finance.

After purchasing my first place, it‚Äôs been a rinse and repeat cycle for me of refinancing, taking the equity gains out as a second mortgage, buying a second place, then refinance both, buy a third, etc etc.

I‚Äôm currently up to 7 units and run them at about a 65% LTV rate to buffer for rate increases and potential decreases in property values over the short term.  The current value of my mortgage debt is around $1.9 million and is all variable rate mortgages. As a whole, my portfolio brings in around $14000 a month most of which goes to servicing mortgage debt as well as expenses. Any surplus cash flow sits around as a buffer should the properties need any repair, experience vacancies, rate increases, etc.  Currently the surplus cash flow is going towards paying down the debt more aggressively as if prime rate was 3% higher than todays current rate to insulate against unforeseen interest changes here in Canada.

I see the current interest rate environment as an opportunity for investors who can weather the storm, to acquire assets at prices that are clearly a little more favourable than they were 6-12 months ago.

My question to other real estate investors are: how do you feel about the current rate environment? Are you also viewing this as an opportunity to invest? What are you doing to safeguard yourself against further increases in rates (beyond what is expected)?

Hi Reddit,

Here is my background:

I am 33m that‚Äôs currently in Software Sales making $225k/Year in Montreal, Canada.

I have gotten into Real Estate, here are some projects:

- I bought a small detached house for 200k in Feb 2021 and sold for 320k in Sept. 2021 with a no renovation. The appreciation of COVID has done well for me in this real estate project.

- I also bought a Quadplex for 530k in June 2021 and it has appreciated to 650k as of today (May 2021).

- I have a Triplex plex which I bought for 820k (prime location) in Jan 2022. I renovated 2 of the units and it has appreciated to approx. 1million as of today (May 2021)


So realizing this‚Ä¶.I make much more money in Real Estate via equity and the rental income and I simply love it more than my day job!

I would like to get into buying, renovating or even constructing new properties but my issue is having capital to do so. I have some liquid cash approx 100k to work with, is it possible to work with business entities such as Business Development of Canada to provide me a large business loan to get into this?

tqktii,RealEstateCanada,1648505762.0,"Hello!

I‚Äôve done some reading on here and saw some similar posts and how people have gotten some good advice on here. So I figured I‚Äôd post my situation and see if any one has some advice on what I should/could do. 

I bought a one bedroom condo in Abbotsford (Canada). This is my first investment property so I am very new to everything. I paid 300k. Right now similar condos are going for 450k. With mortgage payment, strata, insurance etc, I break even every month. I make 180k a year so I was ok with not having a positive cash flow property, as long as I broke even. 

I now want to purchase another rental property. My plan is to get a construction mortgage, so that I can buy land on this lake that is up and coming, and build a nice little cabin to Airbnb. Land is around $50k. And I chatted with a builder that quoted me $250k to build. I‚Äôve done research and I‚Äôm pretty sure I can make, on average (winter being slower) $1000 - $1200 a month. 

I could refinance my rental, but I have a very low interest rate right now (1.49%). I know it‚Äôll cost me around $250-$300 a month extra if I do so. I also considered a heloc, which is 3.20%. 

The risk is, do I refinance and go into negative cash flow of upwards to $300 a month in hopes I make money on second to offset the lose? 

I could do a heloc, and profits could pay the monthly payments. 

I could sell. Which I‚Äôd rather not. But could buy a positive cash flow place, wait and refinance, then buy land. If the positive cash flow is high enough, I could still make money after refinancing, or break even. 

Like I said, I‚Äôm new to all this and not sure how to move onto next investment property. I have a great tenant and he plans on staying long term. I can slowly raise rent but it take forever to make up the lose. If he ever did move out I could easily charge an extra $150 a month.

He's built up a small portfolio of 6 properties over the course of about 20 years and we both have a passion for it. I have recently been mentioning to him that we should try to get into the commercial space. Been browsing online at apartment buildings ranging in the 6-15 unit range for asking prices around 1.8-3.6 million. 

&#x200B;

While we have experience when it comes to single family and duplexes we obviously arent that well versed in apartment buildings so I'm curious if it's the right move or not. The goal is to of course become more profitable and from the research i've done it seems like lenders focus more on the property itself and the noi it generates as opposed to the borrowers income, etc. Thus making it harder to grow a single family portfolio.   


For every building i've inquired about, the financials, aka the rents have been well below market and don't justify the selling price. It most numbers i ran there is either negative cashflow, or to cashflow you would need to put down 40-60% which no one does in real estate considering leverage is the strongest tool.   


Just wondering, is it the right move even if we aren't experiences and b) will the brokers/sellers just think i'm inexperienced if my offers are low or if they think i don't see the upside or value in the deal?",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstateCanada/comments/z1a34k/contemplating_move_from_single_family_to/,Contemplating move from single family to commercial apartments,,0,5,0.5

ycsynl,RealEstateCanada,1666663100.0,"So I was kinda forced to volunteer to be on the condo board - cause no one else wanted to do the job. And I just happened to be present for most town hall meetings. I have no previous experience, but I agreed. 

I am in healthcare, so budgeting is not my strong forte. Recently we reviewed our 2023 projected budget and we are 141,000 short. Although prime is up, the cost of everything is still at inflation. There are 205 units. So that‚Äôs roughly an increase of 57$ in condo fees per unit, that‚Äôs almost a 15-20% increase. We haven‚Äôt had an increase for about 5-6yrs.

Raising the condo fees would depreciate the value of the condos more I presume. The condo market in Edmonton is already depreciating every month. My unit I bought for 195,000 is now selling for 145,000 if I am lucky. So selling is not an option. 

Couple of big projects pending - 1. Building is sinking on one side (it‚Äôs an L shape) found out that the builder cut cost, the two halves are not securely attached and now one side is sinking faster than the other. Multiple cracks have appeared - were told they would be stable by the engineer, who now says we need more reinforcement in the crawl spaces. 2. Replacement of balconies - we don‚Äôt want to open that can of worm just yet but it needs to be assessed so we don‚Äôt get sued for negligence of balconies rotting etc. 


So I guess my question to all condo owners, or more specifically to other condo board members - where do you find the extra cash to close the deficit gap!? What options are there!? Should we increase condo fees to 15% or use the reserve fund for the next couple of years and slowly raise the condo fees?? Reserve fund is about 900,000$.

xlewa7,RealEstateCanada,1663884382.0,"Hi Folks,

&#x200B;

I am new to this subreddit and created a reddit account specifically for real estate and business.

&#x200B;

I have a few rentals that I've converted to duplexes in Ontario, a primary res in downtown Toronto which is a redevelopment project one day, closing a new-con condo in Dec 2023, wife and I have flipped a couple primaries in the past and I perform some private lending. Despite all of this I am not where I want to be due to our day jobs in the corporate world and we are seeking to slow down the lending and buy higher cashflow properties with minimal down to grow wealth instead

&#x200B;

My personal comfort comes with cashflow due to the feeling of that 'safety net' as in, I can quit my job one day.

&#x200B;

Having voiced my desire to use my capital a very generous Redditor from Kentucky spent an hour with me on a zoom call showing me his financial model on how to turn $2M in savings into an amazing, virtually risk free, empire by: 

Purchasing 10x $200,000 out right (over the course of 12-24 months)

Cash-flowing $1,070 each

Then, at house #11, you come up with 50% down (via your cashflow) and borrow against your portfolio for a 50% LTV mortgage. Causing you to lose about $533/mo in previous cash-flow, but the 11th property generates another $1,070.....netting you $537/mo on house #11. Rinse Repeat

&#x200B;

This makes perfect sense to me once he mapped it out (bless that man) and I can't believe I have been stuck in the ""I can't afford anything in Ontario"" mindset for so long. 

&#x200B;

This works in his Louisville KY neigbourhood and is 'risk-free' due to very low vacancy and great tenant laws, but I believe I would rather apply this method ""balls to the wall"" in Canada if possible.

I want to assume that the refinance is an independent protocol from the mortgage approval.

11f5xbt,RealEstateCanada,1677682835.0,"This is my situation, looking for input.  
Primary residence has a large mortgage of $700k, fixed rate of 1.84%, renewing in three years.  


Income property (rented) with a mortgage of $300k, variable, currently at 5.75%.  


I have extra cash flow.  
I'm concerned about the large primary residence mortgage when it renews, but it doesn't make sense to pay it down now due to the low fixed rate.  


Options:

I could make additional payments against the income property mortgage (but the interest is tax deductible against the rental income).  


Or I could build up cash-equivalents (like a high interest ETF, e.g. at 5% [https://horizonsetfs.com/ETF/cash/](https://horizonsetfs.com/ETF/cash/)) in TFSA's. (We have some space).  
And then in three years these could be used to pay down the primary.

The property pre-reno was built 30+ years ago prior to the reno and was presumably previously lived in. This seems to be a bit of a grey area with respect to rent control as the property post-reno was not built or occupied until after November 15, 2018.

I have about ~$135k sitting around. 

Should I buy a $135k 1 bed condo in LCOL and then use the equity to buy a $500k house utilizing the rental income to partially offset costs OR make a downpayment of $135k towards the house and keep one property only.
Buying a condo will give me peace of mind that at least I‚Äôve a property given how the situation is overall.
